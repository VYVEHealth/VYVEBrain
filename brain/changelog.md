# VYVE Brain Changelog

## 2026-04-10 (evening — bug fixes session)

### workouts.html — fix: reorder wipes in-progress sets
- `saveReorder()` now snapshots kg/reps/ticked/bw/notes per exercise name before calling `renderSessionBody()`, then restores after. Mid-session reorder no longer wipes workout progress.
- commit b93fd175

### theme.css + auth.js — feat: portrait orientation lock
- CSS `#vyve-rotate-overlay` shown via `@media (orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 430px)` — phone-only, not tablets.
- `vyvePortraitLock()` IIFE in auth.js: calls `screen.orientation.lock('portrait')` (Android) and injects the overlay div into every portal page automatically — no per-page changes needed.
- iOS Safari ignores the API; CSS overlay handles iOS.
- Decision: overlay kept post-Capacitor as safety net for browser access. Suppress during active workout session is a known backlog item.
- sw.js bumped to vyve-cache-v2026-04-10f

### workouts.html — fix: PR/history scroll lock + content hidden under nav
- `openPrsView()` / `openSessionsHistory()` now clear `body.overflow` so fixed overlay scrolls on iOS (body:hidden was blocking touch events).
- `closePrsView()` / `closeSessionsHistory()` re-apply body lock if session still active.
- Both views reset `scrollTop = 0` on open.
- `.prs-body` and `.sh-body` bottom padding now `calc(80px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom,0px))` — last items no longer hidden under nav.
- Both fixed views get `-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch` + `overscroll-behavior:contain`.
- sw.js bumped to vyve-cache-v2026-04-10g

### workouts.html — feat: persist active session across navigation
- Navigating away (e.g. Sessions tab) and back no longer resets a workout.
- `saveSessionState()` serialises currentSessionData, sessionExercises, sessionLog, completedSetsCount, all DOM state (kg/reps/ticked/bw/notes), and timer to `localStorage` key `vyve_active_session`.
- Called on session start and every set tick.
- `restoreSessionState()` called at end of `init()` — reopens session view with all progress and timer intact if saved state exists and is under 4 hours old.
- Cleared on `closeSessionView()` (explicit exit) and `completeWorkout()` (done).
- sw.js bumped to vyve-cache-v2026-04-10h


## 2026-04-10 (evening — portrait lock)

### theme.css + auth.js — feat: portrait orientation lock
- **Problem:** Portal pages rotated freely to landscape on phone rotation. VYVE is portrait-only — landscape is always accidental on a phone.
- **CSS (theme.css):** Added `#vyve-rotate-overlay` — a fixed full-screen overlay with a rotating phone icon and message. Shown via `@media (orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 430px)` so it only triggers on phone-sized landscape, not tablets. Overlay sits above `#app` but does not unmount it — no state loss.
- **JS (auth.js):** `vyvePortraitLock()` IIFE injected at bottom of auth.js. Calls `screen.orientation.lock('portrait')` (Android Chrome). Also injects the `#vyve-rotate-overlay` div into the DOM on every portal page at load — no per-page changes needed.
- iOS Safari ignores the API lock; CSS overlay handles iOS.
- sw.js bumped vyve-cache-v2026-04-10e → vyve-cache-v2026-04-10f


## 2026-04-10 (evening)

### workouts.html — fix: reorder wipes in-progress sets
- **Bug:** Opening the reorder modal mid-session and saving the new order called `renderSessionBody()`, which rebuilt the entire DOM from scratch. All ticked sets, kg/reps values, and bodyweight toggles were lost.
- **Fix:** `saveReorder()` now captures a snapshot of all per-exercise DOM state (kg, reps, ticked, bodyweight, notes) keyed by exercise name before reordering. After `renderSessionBody()` re-renders, the snapshot is replayed back into the new DOM positions.
- Exercise name is the stable key — this works correctly because reorder doesn't change the exercises, only their positions.
- commit b93fd175

### sw.js — cache bump vyve-cache-v2026-04-10d → vyve-cache-v2026-04-10e


## 2026-04-10 (late evening session)

### settings.html — 3 fixes
- `<!--email_off-->` tags stripped from `mailto:team@vyvehealth.co.uk` href — Cloudflare was injecting them literally, breaking iOS Mail — commit 737fadd
- Privacy Policy link corrected from `/privacy` (404) to `/privacy.html` — commit c8d7d40
- Both fixes atomic, settings.html is clean

### how-to-videos.html + how-to-pdfs.html — replaced with placeholders
- Both pages had custom nav markup, no theme.js, no nav.js, no auth gate, no SW registration
- Replaced entirely with clean placeholder pages (coming soon)
- Each now has: theme.js, nav.js, auth gate IIFE, SW registration, proper `data-theme="dark"` default
- Back button and standard VYVE nav now work on both pages — commit 32461c3
- sw.js cache bumped vyve-cache-v2026-04-10c → vyve-cache-v2026-04-10d

### running-plan.html — max_tokens fix
- `max_tokens` was hard-coded to `4096` when Haiku was switched in on 6 April (commit 758b572)
- Original code had `getMaxTokens(goal)` — marathon was 10,000, half was 7,000
- 20-week marathon plan (Stuart Watts) was being truncated mid-JSON every time
- Fixed: `max_tokens` raised to `16000` — covers all plan combinations with headroom
- Bonus: stripped `<!--email_off-->` Cloudflare tags from monthly limit mailto link — commit cb729bb

## 2026-04-10 (late evening session)

### generate-workout-plan — Full Restoration + Video Fix
- Discovered v4 had two unintentional regressions vs original onboarding v42:
  1. `programme_name` was hardcoded template instead of AI-generated
  2. `programme_rationale` was hardcoded template instead of AI-generated
- Root cause of Stuart's missing videos/thumbnails identified:
  - AI-generated plans invent exercise names (e.g. "Barbell Bench Press")
  - `workout_plans` library uses different format (e.g. "Bench Press – Barbell")
  - `workouts.html` uses strict equality match (`===`) — no fuzzy matching
  - This was always the case for AI plans; videos only worked when Stuart was on the static fallback library
- Deployed `generate-workout-plan` v5 with full restoration:
  - Step 1: `generateProgrammeOverview()` restored — AI generates personalised programme name and rationale (matches original onboarding v42 behaviour)
  - Step 2: Exercise library fetched from `workout_plans` table at runtime and injected into prompt — AI MUST use only approved exercise names
  - Step 3: After plan generation, each exercise enriched with `video_url` + `thumbnail_url` via direct lookup against library
  - Plan generation still uses two parallel calls (weeks 1-4, weeks 5-8) to avoid 16k token limit
- Stuart's plan regenerated with v5: "PPL Holiday Shred" — 8 weeks, 32 sessions, 212/212 exercises matched to videos
- `generate-workout-plan` is now the canonical plan generation path — onboarding v43 calls it as fire-and-forget

### Known Architecture Note
- `workouts.html` `getVideoUrl()` / `getThumbnailUrl()` use strict name equality — this is fine now that the EF constrains AI to library names
- If any future plan has unmatched exercises (v5 logs warnings), the issue will be in the prompt constraint, not the frontend


## 2026-04-10 (evening session)

### Password Reset Flow — Full Fix
- Root cause: `login.html` had `redirectTo` pointing to `login.html` instead of `set-password.html`
- Fixed `redirectTo` in `login.html` to `https://online.vyvehealth.co.uk/set-password.html`
- Fixed `set-password.html` to call `signOut(scope: global)` after password update, then redirect to `login.html?reset=success`
- Added success banner on `login.html` when `?reset=success` param present
- Added "Link already used" card to `set-password.html` with inline resend form — user can request new link without navigating away
- Increased invalid link timeout from 3s to 5s for slow mobile connections
- Supabase SMTP configured to send via Brevo (`smtp-relay.brevo.com:587`) — emails now send from VYVE Health <team@vyvehealth.co.uk> not Supabase Auth
- Brevo domain `vyvehealth.co.uk` verified (DKIM + DMARC green) via GoDaddy DNS
- Reset email template updated to table-based HTML button (renders correctly in all email clients)
- cache bumped: `vyve-cache-v2026-04-10a` → `b` → `c`

### Workouts.html — Nav Overlap Fixes
- Rest timer sheet and reorder exercises sheet were rendering behind the bottom nav bar
- Fixed `ex-menu-sheet` padding-bottom: `calc(72px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`
- Fixed `reorder-sheet` padding-bottom: `calc(84px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` and max-height: `calc(80vh - 65px)`
- Fixed `reorder-save-btn` bottom margin
- cache bumped: `vyve-cache-v2026-04-10c`

### Workout Plan Generation — Architecture Fix
- Root cause: `waitUntil` in onboarding EF has a hard timeout; advanced PPL plans (~14k tokens output) were silently failing
- Stuart Watts (`stuwatts09@gmail.com`) had no plan in `workout_plan_cache` — was seeing static fallback library
- Deployed new `generate-workout-plan` Edge Function (v4) as standalone dedicated EF
  - Generates weeks 1-4 and weeks 5-8 in two parallel API calls, stitches together
  - `max_tokens: 16000` per call — handles largest possible plans
  - `stop_reason` guard: fails loudly if output truncated, never writes corrupt data
- Updated `onboarding` EF to v43: replaces inline `waitUntil(generateWorkoutPlan)` with fire-and-forget fetch to `generate-workout-plan` EF
- Stuart's plan generated manually and written to `workout_plan_cache`: 8 weeks, 32 sessions, 36,521 chars
- Plan join verified — week 4→5 transition seamless (same exercises, correct progressive overload step)

### Stuart Watts — Account Notes
- Two accounts exist: `swatts@geoffreyrobinson.co.uk` (Feb 2026, old/legacy) and `stuwatts09@gmail.com` (10 Apr 2026, active)
- Active account is `stuwatts09@gmail.com` — RIVER persona, 4-day PPL, Advanced, Gym
- Old account has 12 workout logs with null plan/name (logged via legacy flow)
- All workout data safe — nothing deleted

## 2026-04-10 (evening)

### Repo Hygiene
- `VYVEHealth/VYVEBrain` set to private — contains Supabase IDs, API keys references, commercial pipeline
- Removed duplicate `brain-sync.md` from repo root (canonical copy is `playbooks/brain-sync.md`)

### vyve-site Actions Cleanup
- Deleted dead `.github/workflows/inject-key.yml` — legacy workflow from before `anthropic-proxy` EF existed
- Verified `running-plan.html` already uses `anthropic-proxy` EF v5 (no placeholder, no key in HTML)
- `static.yml` (GitHub Pages deploy) retained — only workflow now running on vyve-site
- Commit: f557dae

## 2026-04-10 (morning/afternoon session)

### Daily Report Fixed
- `BREVO_API_KEY` secret was missing/wrong in Supabase — renamed to correct value
- `daily-report` v16 deployed — added full activity detail table (member name, type, specific activity, time)
- Report manually triggered and confirmed sending to team@vyvehealth.co.uk

### Password Reset Flow Fixed
- Supabase Site URL updated to `https://online.vyvehealth.co.uk/set-password.html`
- `set-password.html` confirmed correctly handles `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` token event
- Supabase email template updated: new VYVE-branded HTML body, subject now "Reset your VYVE password"

### Welcome Emails Resent
- Alan Bird and Owen Barrett identified as missing welcome emails (onboarded while Brevo key was absent)
- `resend-welcome` one-shot EF deployed — resent branded welcome with fresh set-password links
- BCC to team@vyvehealth.co.uk confirmed working on all future onboarding emails

### Backlog Updated
- Added: password reset email template (desktop task)
- Added: Exercise page redesign (product idea — gym / cardio / walking plan umbrella)

### Product Thinking
- Discussed replacing "Workouts" nav item with "Exercise" umbrella page
- Members choose path at onboarding: gym programme, running plan, walking/activity plan, or mix
- Each path generates an 8-week personalised plan (Sandra use case — non-gym corporate members)
- Key open question: do non-gym plans use same `workout_plan_cache` structure or simpler format?
- Decision deferred — parked in backlog under Later
