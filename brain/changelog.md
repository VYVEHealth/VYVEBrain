## 2026-04-24 — HealthKit session 7a: workout cap now source-aware; collateral fix for broken `queue_health_write_back`

Pre-work for the habits × HealthKit auto-tick plan. The existing `cap_workouts` / `cap_cardio` BEFORE INSERT triggers cap at 2/day and divert overflow to `activity_dedupe` — designed for manual-entry spam prevention, but wrong for Apple Watch members who routinely do 3+ sessions a day (morning run, lunchtime class, evening strength). A third HK-sourced workout was silently disappearing from workouts.html, from the member's 30-activity charity count, and from the leaderboard. Fix needs to ship before any habit rule saying "complete a workout" is evaluated against Watch data, otherwise auto-tick would disagree with reality.

### Schema change — `source` column on workouts + cardio

```sql
alter table public.workouts add column source text not null default 'manual';
alter table public.cardio   add column source text not null default 'manual';
```

Default `'manual'` means all existing rows retro-populate as manual (53 workouts, 21 cardio at time of migration) and new manual inserts from the PWA continue working unchanged without any client-side patch. Retro-stamped the 2 workouts and 9 cardio rows that `sync-health-data` v2 had promoted from HK samples during session 5's backfill — joined via `member_health_samples.promoted_to` / `promoted_id` and updated `source = 'healthkit'` on the target rows. Provenance now accurate across the whole table.

### Check constraint drop — `session_number` can no longer be capped at {1,2}

The `workouts_session_number_check` and `cardio_session_number_check` check constraints (`session_number = ANY (ARRAY[1,2])`) were tied to the old 2/day cap. With the cap lifted for HK rows, a 3rd HK-sourced workout on the same day would violate the constraint even though the trigger now allows it. Both constraints dropped. `sync-health-data` continues to send `session_number: 1` on every HK-promoted row — it was never used for ordering anyway (`logged_at` serves that purpose), and no unique constraint references it.

### Trigger rewrite — `cap_workouts` and `cap_cardio` source-aware

```sql
if coalesce(new.source, 'manual') = 'manual' then
  if (select count(*) from workouts
       where member_email = new.member_email
         and activity_date = new.activity_date
         and coalesce(source, 'manual') = 'manual') >= 2 then
    insert into activity_dedupe (...) values (...);
    return null;
  end if;
end if;
return new;
```

Key property: non-manual rows bypass the cap entirely and the cap counts only manual rows. A member who logs 2 manual workouts, then has 4 HK workouts sync, then tries to log a 3rd manual — the 3rd manual still diverts to dedupe (manual count is 2, not 6). Watch-heavy members get all their sessions counted; no change to manual spam prevention.

### Charity + cert counters stay naturally capped at 2/day

Checked before shipping: `get_charity_total()` uses its own `LEAST(COUNT(*), 2)` in the UNION ALL, and `increment_workout_counter()` / `increment_cardio_counter()` check `existing_count < 2` before bumping `members.cert_workouts_count` / `cert_cardio_count`. Both independent of the BEFORE INSERT trigger. Lifting the trigger cap for HK inflates nothing downstream — charity months and certificate tier progression remain capped at 2/day per activity type by design. Real additional activity shows on the member's dashboard and leaderboard but doesn't unfairly rocket the charity counter past its intended pace. Clean separation.

### Collateral discovery — `queue_health_write_back()` crashed on any workouts INSERT

Caught by the first live test. The AFTER INSERT trigger `queue_health_write_back_workouts` on `public.workouts` calls the shared `queue_health_write_back()` function, whose IF clause was:

```
if TG_TABLE_NAME = 'weight_logs' and NEW.native_uuid is not null then
  return NEW;
end if;
```

plpgsql tries to resolve `NEW.native_uuid` against the composite type of NEW (workouts for a workouts trigger firing). Workouts table has no `native_uuid` column, so the reference fails with `record "new" has no field "native_uuid"` before the AND short-circuits. Any workouts INSERT for a member with a `member_health_connections` row would throw. Session 5d's cleanup note had reassured us this trigger was "zero runtime cost (WHERE clause matches zero rows without the scope granted)" — wrong, the function crashed before reaching the WHERE. Only reason it hadn't exploded yet: the three live members without HK connections don't trigger the evaluation cost, and the two HK-connected members (me + possibly Lewis) hadn't manually logged workouts since session 5d shipped 24 April earlier.

Fixed defensively by nesting: outer `if TG_TABLE_NAME = 'weight_logs'` gates the inner `to_jsonb(NEW) ->> 'native_uuid'` jsonb-safe check. jsonb extraction works on any composite type; direct field access does not. Function now safe for `workouts`, `cardio`, `weight_logs`, and any future table that gets the trigger attached.

### `sync-health-data` v6 — stamps `source: 'healthkit'` on promoted rows

Promotion path in `promoteMapping()` now passes the platform tag through and attaches it to both the `workouts` and `cardio` row payloads. Without this the NOT NULL DEFAULT 'manual' would make every HK-promoted row look like a manual entry, which would cap-count and negate the trigger fix. Signature change: `promoteMapping(sample, memberEmail, sourceTag)`. Weight rows unchanged — `weight_logs` has no source column.

The pre-existing `promoted.skipped_cap` counter in handlePullSamples continues not to fire correctly when the cap trigger returns NULL (empty data, no error, neither branch runs) — noted but not fixed in v6 because with source stamping in place no HK row will be cap-triggered anyway. If we later add non-manual non-HK sources (Strava direct, Strong direct, etc.), the counter semantics need revisiting.

### End-to-end validation via transactional rollback

Asserted in a `DO` block that ended with a tagged `raise exception` so nothing persisted:

```
TEST_PASS_ROLLBACK hk=4 manual=2 dedupe=1
```

4 HK workouts written source='healthkit' bypassed the cap as intended. 2 manual rows land normally. 3rd manual routes to activity_dedupe. All seven triggers on the workouts table fire cleanly. Transaction rolls back on exception so no test data hits live tables.

### Files changed

- Supabase: `workouts.source` + `cardio.source` columns added; session_number check constraints dropped; `cap_workouts` + `cap_cardio` rewritten source-aware; `queue_health_write_back` nested-conditional fix; 2 workouts + 9 cardio rows retro-stamped `source='healthkit'`.
- Supabase EF: `sync-health-data` v6 ACTIVE (stamps source on promotion).
- Brain: this entry + backlog tick for Autotick pre-req; `plans/habits-healthkit-autotick.md` revised to reflect queryAggregated/member_health_daily routing and mark session 0 (sleep_state patch) and session 7a (cap fix) complete.

### Gotchas codified

1. **plpgsql triggers that dereference `NEW.<column>` only resolve against the specific table's composite type.** A shared trigger function attached to multiple tables must not reference a column that exists on only some of them — even inside an IF guard — because plpgsql evaluates the reference as part of compiling the expression, not as part of short-circuit evaluation. Use `to_jsonb(NEW) ->> 'column_name'` for defensive access across table types.
2. **Activity caps that were originally spam-prevention guards don't map onto third-party data sources.** Source-discriminate the cap (`manual` vs everything else) rather than dropping it entirely — otherwise manual logging regains its original spam vector.
3. **`promoted.skipped_cap` in sync-health-data only counts `error` branch hits, not `data=[]` empty returns from BEFORE INSERT NULL.** When a cap trigger diverts to activity_dedupe, PostgREST returns 200 with empty data (not an error). Any future source-aware audit needs to compare `insertedSamples.length` against `promoted.workouts + promoted.cardio + promoted.skipped_cap` and surface the delta.

### Outstanding for session 7

- Full rewrite of `brain/master.md` — session 6's pipeline changes and session 7a's cap fix together constitute enough schema + EF change that the existing master will drift quickly if patched. Needs its own session: audit of all live EF versions (sync-health-data v6, member-dashboard v50, certificate-checker v9, etc.), table inventory including `member_health_daily`, trigger inventory including source-aware caps and fixed `queue_health_write_back`, updated Hard Rules (plpgsql NEW dereference + source discrimination).
- Autotick sessions 7b–7d per the revised plan: schema + habit library additions (Lewis sign-off on copy/difficulty), server rule evaluator in `member-dashboard` v51+, client UI + editing bug fix combined.

### Commits this session

- Supabase: 7 migrations + 1 EF deploy (`sync-health-data` v6 ACTIVE)
- Brain: this entry + session 6 writeup + backlog update + autotick plan revision

## 2026-04-24 — HealthKit session 6: pipeline rebuild around `queryAggregated`, new `member_health_daily` aggregate table, BST bucket fix, two views parked

Session 5's finish left one big open item: verify the six non-workout sample types (steps, distance, active_energy, heart_rate, sleep, weight) actually land on the next on-device sync now that the `readSamples` client fix and the workout-type normalisation EF fix had both shipped. Initial spot-check on-device showed steps/distance/active_energy landing — but heavy. Eight days of raw step samples for one member was hundreds of small rows each covering ~10 minutes of walking. By the time the `apple-health.html` inspector page tried to render 954 samples inline the payload was a blocker for any page that wanted to do day-level aggregation over 30 days.

Architectural pivot: for metrics where Apple exposes a native aggregation API (`HKStatisticsCollectionQuery` via Capgo's `queryAggregated`), pull daily totals directly on-device and store pre-aggregated rows. For metrics where the fine-grained shape matters (heart rate samples, sleep state segments, weight readings as point-in-time events), keep pulling into `member_health_samples` where they belong.

### New table — `member_health_daily`

Long-format. One row per `(member_email, source, sample_type, date)` tuple:

- `member_email text`, `source text`, `sample_type text`, `date date`, `value numeric`, `unit text`, `preferred_source text nullable`, `ingested_at timestamptz default now()`
- Primary key / unique: `(member_email, source, sample_type, date)` with the EF upserting on conflict
- `ALLOWED_DAILY_TYPES = {steps, distance, active_energy}` in the EF allowlist
- `preferred_source` reserved for a future multi-source dedupe arbiter (e.g. when a member connects both HealthKit and Fitbit). Currently null across all rows; not read by the EF. Rule evaluators should filter on `source = 'healthkit'` until the arbiter lands.

The value column stores whatever Apple's `HKStatisticsCollectionQuery` returned for that bucket: integer step counts, metres for distance, kilocalories for active_energy. Units are preserved as-is from HK and stored per row so downstream conversions are explicit.

### Watch-vs-iPhone dedupe is native in HealthKit, not in our code

`HKStatisticsCollectionQuery` with `sumQuantitySamples` across all sources that contributed to a bucket returns one value per day with Apple's internal priority logic already applied — Watch takes precedence over iPhone for overlapping windows, motion sensors on the wrist are preferred over phone accelerometer when both are present. This replaces what would have been a painful hand-rolled dedupe if we'd aggregated from `member_health_samples` ourselves. Saves us from a class of subtle double-counting bugs (a walk logged on the watch would also be counted by the phone in the member's pocket).

### BST bucket-anchor bug squashed

Early inspector readouts were showing daily buckets landing a day behind the actual walk. Root cause: `HKStatisticsCollectionQuery` anchors buckets to midnight local time, but the client was serialising the anchor with a default `Date` constructor that parses as UTC. During BST (+01:00) the anchor at midnight UK = 23:00 the previous day UTC, so yesterday's step count tagged with today minus one. Fix was client-side: construct the bucket anchor from local year/month/day components (`new Date(+y, +m-1, +d, 0, 0, 0, 0)`) rather than passing an ISO string through `new Date(...)`. Codifies the recurring BST gotcha that's bitten several portal areas (per memory) — TL;DR for future sessions: any date-math that crosses a day boundary near midnight must use local construction, never UTC parsing.

### handlePushDaily EF handler — sync-health-data v5

Client posts `{action: "push_daily", platform: "healthkit", daily: [{sample_type, date, value, unit}, ...]}` with the 60-day window it has. EF validates against `ALLOWED_DAILY_TYPES`, enforces a 60-day freshness cutoff (matching pull_samples), outlier-checks steps (reject if >200,000/day), and upserts to `member_health_daily` with `onConflict: 'member_email,source,sample_type,date'`. Batch limit 200 rows per call. Returns `{ok, upserted, skipped}` with skipped counts broken out by reason (invalid, too_old, bad_type, bad_value).

### Samples path still carries the rich-segment types

`member_health_samples` continues to land heart rate point samples, sleep segments (with `metadata.sleep_state` preserved from session 5's sampleToEF extension), and weight readings. Sleep segments carry Apple's full state vocabulary — today's 30-day distribution for my account: 1,609 min `light`, 693 min `rem`, 308 min `deep`, 223 min `asleep` (legacy consolidated state from pre-iOS-16 devices), 77 min `awake`. Rule evaluators for sleep should sum across `{light, rem, deep, asleep}` and exclude `{awake, inBed}`.

Note: `active_energy` still appears in `member_health_samples` as 6 point samples, overlapping with its aggregated representation in `member_health_daily`. Intentional — the daily aggregate is for fast habit-rule evaluation and dashboard display; the raw samples stay for future analytics. Any consumer computing daily totals MUST read from `member_health_daily` not aggregate the samples (the daily row is the deduped Apple-authoritative value; the samples are unreliable for summation across sources).

### End-to-end validation on-device

- My account this morning: smart scale Bluetooth-synced → Apple Health → HKSample → Capgo readSamples → `member_health_samples` as weight=88.550000001 kg at 06:48 UTC → `promoteMapping` → `weight_logs.weight_kg=88.55` with matching `logged_at`. Visible on nutrition.html. Shadow-read guard prevents next sync echoing it back.
- Today's daily row: 9,136 steps, 833 active kcal, 6.8 km distance. Matches the Watch's Activity app.
- Heart rate: 775 samples for the three days since the fix shipped, point values with start/end timestamps, averaging to resting ~60 bpm for my account.
- Sleep: 169 segments over the 30-day window, fine-grained (1–32 min per segment), `sleep_state` metadata populated for every segment.

### Two views built and parked

Apple Health inspector (`apple-health.html`) and personal activity feed (`activity.html`) were both wired up during the session and both ended up shelved.

**apple-health.html** — Samples-table inspector intended to give me (and future devs) a single pane to debug what's arriving from Capgo. Works functionally; renders correctly on small payloads. With 954 samples in scope the inline rendering chokes — not an engineering mystery, just payload mass. Shelving for now is cheap because the page is unlinked from nav and nothing depends on it. When it's needed next it wants paging and/or virtualised rendering, or ideally a samples-query filter that restricts the pull to the last 24–48 hours by default.

**activity.html** — Personal self-view of recent workouts + cardio. Built, then removed from the Exercise Hub (`exercise.html`) because without GPS route maps on running/cycling entries it felt distinctly second-rate compared to Strava/Apple Health's own views. GPS would require either a direct Apple MapKit integration (iOS-only, Capacitor plugin fork) or pulling route polylines from HealthKit's workout metadata (not exposed by Capgo 8.4.7). Both out of scope for v1. The page stays in the repo unlinked — good chance the concept reappears inside a community/social context (feed of team activity, not per-member self-view) rather than as a personal surface, so the scaffolding is worth keeping.

### Currently active EF trail

- `sync-health-data` v5 ACTIVE — push_daily + pull_samples + confirm_write + mark_revoked handlers
- `member-dashboard` v50 — server-authoritative health feature flag + health_connections hydration (from session 5c)
- Client `healthbridge.js` — readSamples + queryAggregated calls + BST-safe daily bucket construction + sleepState metadata folding

### Outstanding for session 7+

- Workout cap collision with HK multi-workout days — split into its own pre-req session (session 7a).
- Habits × HealthKit auto-tick — rewrite the plan against the new routing (daily table for steps/distance/active_energy; samples for sleep; promoted workouts/cardio tables for completion rules).
- Full rewrite of `brain/master.md` — too much change since last rewrite.
- `apple-health.html` paging or scoped-pull rework before unshelving.
- `promoted.skipped_cap` counter semantics in sync-health-data — only counts errors, not BEFORE-INSERT NULL returns.
- Write-path round-trip still needs on-device validation for the workouts write target (dead-path; Capgo has no saveWorkout, but the schema reserves the lane).

### Commits this session

- vyve-site: session 6 work at commit `37ad068` — `healthbridge.js` queryAggregated integration + BST-safe daily bucket construction + push_daily client invocation; `apple-health.html` built (unlinked); `activity.html` built then unlinked from exercise.html
- Supabase: `member_health_daily` table created; `sync-health-data` v3 → v4 → v5 deployed ACTIVE through the session (weight native_uuid in v3, diagnostics persistence in v4, push_daily handler in v5)
- Brain: this entry (written retrospectively in session 7a)

## 2026-04-24 — HealthKit session 5: spot-check unearthed silent type-drop + failed promotion, taxonomy normalisation, server-authoritative feature flag, banner regression fix, and dead-path cleanup

Started the session aiming to close out HealthKit before broader testing — move off the localStorage dev flag, run the write-path round-trip, think through rollout. Step 1 was meant to be a five-minute spot-check of the initial 30-day pull that Session 4 logged as "completed" but that nobody had actually verified. It took ten minutes and surfaced two bugs that would have corrupted every subsequent test. The rest of the session was unwinding that.

### Finding 1 — only workouts reached `member_health_samples`

Query against the table for `deanonbrown@hotmail.com` returned 7 rows, all `sample_type='workout'`. Zero rows for steps, heart_rate, weight, active_energy, sleep, or distance, even though all seven scopes had been granted at connect time. Connection row said `last_sync_status: ok` with `total_synced: 0`.

Root cause: client-side. `healthbridge.js`'s `pullAllSamples` calls `plugin.querySamples()` for the six non-workout types. Capgo `@capgo/capacitor-health` 8.4.7 exposes no `querySamples` method — the correct name is `readSamples`. The `safe()` wrapper in `pullAllSamples` caught the six TypeErrors, logged them as console warnings, and returned `null`, dropping every sample. The Session 4 taxonomy audit had codified the real method list as `isAvailable, requestAuthorization, checkAuthorization, readSamples, saveSample, getPluginVersion, openHealthConnectSettings, showPrivacyPolicy, queryWorkouts, queryAggregated` — but the client was never patched to match. Six data types have been silently failing since Session 4 shipped.

### Finding 2 — all 7 workouts sat unpromoted

Of the 7 `workout` samples that did make it in, zero had `promoted_to` set. The samples were real — 3 Apple Watch runs (29 Mar, 4 Apr, 22 Apr), 2 Apple Watch walks (31 Mar, 1 Apr), 2 Strong-app strength sessions (both 7 Apr, both ~1 minute — mis-logs in Strong, not a VYVE concern).

Root cause: server-side. `sync-health-data` v1's promotion logic did `WORKOUT_TO_CARDIO.has(wt)` against a set of UpperCamelCase names (`"Running"`, `"Walking"`, `"TraditionalStrengthTraining"`). The Capgo plugin's `queryWorkouts` response uses lowerCamelCase (`"running"`, `"walking"`, `"strengthTraining"`), which is also what the Swift source's `HealthDataType` and workout-type enums serialize to. Every sample fell through to the `return null` branch — "unknown workout type, keep raw".

### Finding 3 — `total_synced` counter stomped on every re-sync

Minor, included for completeness: the EF's `upsert` uses `ignoreDuplicates: true`, so on a second sync with all-duplicate inserts the `.select()` returns `[]` and `total_synced` gets set to 0. Should be additive. Cosmetic — not fixed.

### Fix 1 — `sync-health-data` v2 with normalised workout-type matching

Rewrote the promotion path to be taxonomy-agnostic. Added `normWorkoutType(s) = String(s).toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, "")` and built canonical sets of normalised tokens. `running` / `Running` / `RUNNING` all collapse to `running`; `strengthTraining` / `STRENGTH_TRAINING` / `TraditionalStrengthTraining` handled distinctly but in the same strength set. Yoga-duration branching preserved. Ignored set expanded to cover the full HK leisure-sport list plus Health Connect variants. EF deployed as v2 (ACTIVE).

### Backfill — one-shot promotion for the 7 existing unpromoted samples

EF's promotion loop only iterates over freshly-inserted samples, so a re-sync with the now-fixed EF wouldn't re-promote the existing 7 rows (blocked by `native_uuid` conflict). SQL DO block mirrored the EF's `promoteMapping` logic against `member_health_samples` where `promoted_to IS NULL AND sample_type='workout'`. Result: 5 rows → `cardio`, 2 rows → `workouts`, all with correct `day_of_week`, `time_of_day`, `duration_minutes`, `logged_at`. `promoted_to` and `promoted_id` backfilled on the source rows. Safe to re-run (filters on unpromoted only).

### vyve-site commits (all on main)

**Session 5a — [e060edc](https://github.com/VYVEHealth/vyve-site/commit/e060edcdcd4d64b88e72044fa8752bab81bbebfb).** `healthbridge.js` now calls `plugin.readSamples()` instead of the non-existent `querySamples()`. Added `s.platformId` to the `native_uuid` fallback chain in `sampleToEF` — `readSamples` exposes the HealthKit UUID there, previously we fell through to a synthetic `start_iso + end_iso + value` uuid that would have defeated the shadow-read guard on re-ingestion of the same sample. Comment in `pullAllSamples` rewritten to reflect the actual Capgo 8.4.7 API surface. `sw.js` bumped to `v2026-04-24a-healthkit-readsamples`.

**Session 5b — [31cee69](https://github.com/VYVEHealth/vyve-site/commit/31cee694fc7136fbc1dc02f136feceeaea57c78f).** Pink re-prompt banner on `index.html` was appearing for connected users. Reported by Dean at 00:44 BST showing the "Get more from VYVE / Connect Apple Health" banner despite being connected the evening prior.

Root cause: the banner's gate read `healthBridge.getState()`, which reads `localStorage['vyve_health_state']` with a 10-minute TTL. Dean's last successful sync was 22:41 UTC on 23 April; by ~23:44 UTC the cache had expired. `getState()` returned `null`. Banner's `if (st && st.connected) return` didn't short-circuit. Banner rendered. The server knew the truth (`member_health_connections` row for Dean had `revoked_at: null`), but the client never consulted it — `getState()` only reads the expiring cache. This would have hit every connected user reliably after 10 minutes of idle.

Fix: persistent flag. `healthbridge.js`'s `sync()` now writes `localStorage.vyve_healthkit_has_connected = '1'` alongside the expiring state cache on every successful sync. `disconnect()` clears it. `index.html`'s banner init checks the persistent flag first, falling back to `getState()`. `hbBannerConnect`'s success path also sets the flag (belt-and-braces). `sw.js` bumped to `v2026-04-24b-banner-connected-flag`.

**Session 5c — [d31f380](https://github.com/VYVEHealth/vyve-site/commit/d31f380616c9b82e0a9d540def39262f720ecfe8).** The 5b fix addressed the symptom. The real architectural gap was that 5b wrote the flag only when `sync()` ran — it doesn't help a user who just opened the app and whose cache has since expired.

Proper fix: server-authoritative hydration. On every page load where `healthbridge.js` is present (index, settings, workouts, nutrition), it now fetches `member-dashboard` v50 after `vyveAuthReady` and populates three things:

- `window.__VYVE_HEALTH_FEATURE_ALLOWED__` from `data.health_feature_allowed` (the server-side allowlist — currently Dean only)
- `localStorage.vyve_healthkit_has_connected` when `data.health_connections` has a non-revoked row for the current platform
- `vyve_health_state` cache seeded from server state so `getState()` returns `connected: true` instantly, without waiting for a fresh sync

This is the proper replacement for the localStorage-only `vyve_healthkit_dev` feature gate. The dev flag remains as an OR fallback in `isFeatureEnabled()` for rapid dev testing on non-allowlist accounts — can be removed in a later pass once the server path is confirmed stable.

New public API method `window.healthBridge.hydrateFromDashboard(data)` lets pages that already fetch `member-dashboard` (index.html does, for rendering the home screen) pass their response in directly — the internal `_hasHydrated` boolean prevents double-work. Not yet wired from index.html, so currently there are two dashboard fetches per home-page load; small perf tax, fine for now, cleanup item.

Field-shape note for future work: `member-dashboard` v50's `health_connections` rows return `is_revoked: boolean` (not `revoked_at: string | null` as the raw `member_health_connections` table shape suggests). Codified.

`sw.js` bumped to `v2026-04-24c-server-hydration`.

**Session 5d — [fbc0ddb](https://github.com/VYVEHealth/vyve-site/commit/fbc0ddb80cca063d05ca32878fcf66025f456023).** Dead-code cleanup. `healthbridge.js`'s `flushPendingWrites` had an `else if (tgt === 'workouts')` branch that called `plugin.writeWorkout()`. Capgo 8.4.7 exposes no such method — Session 4 taxonomy audit codified this as "only `saveSample` for quantity/category types; no `saveWorkout`". The branch was unreachable in practice (server trigger `queue_health_write_back()` gates workout queuing on `'write_workouts' = any(granted_scopes)`, and `DEFAULT_WRITE_SCOPES = ['weight']` means that scope is never requested), but it was masquerading as a supported feature.

Removed the branch. The fallback `else` now handles any non-`weight_logs` target by marking the ledger row `failed` with `error_message = 'write_target_unsupported_' + tgt`, so if the server ever starts returning workout ledger entries (e.g., a v2 plugin upgrade) they get cleanly failed instead of throwing a TypeError on the missing plugin method.

The DB-side `queue_health_write_back_workouts` trigger on `public.workouts` is left in place — it's zero runtime cost (WHERE clause matches zero rows without the scope granted) and preserves the migration path for whenever workout write-back lands in v2.

`sw.js` bumped to `v2026-04-24d-write-path-cleanup`.

### State of play

**vyve-site latest:** [fbc0ddb](https://github.com/VYVEHealth/vyve-site/commit/fbc0ddb80cca063d05ca32878fcf66025f456023). SW cache: `v2026-04-24d-write-path-cleanup`. Five commits today: `sync-health-data` EF v2 + backfill, then 5a/5b/5c/5d.

Dean's account on Supabase: 7 workout samples all promoted (5 cardio, 2 workouts, visible on cardio.html/workouts.html for the right dates). Six missing sample types (steps, HR, weight, active_energy, sleep, distance) will land on his next on-device sync now that `readSamples` is wired.

Feature gate: dev flag `localStorage.vyve_healthkit_dev` still works as fallback but is no longer required — the `HEALTH_FEATURE_ALLOWLIST` Set in `member-dashboard` v50 is now the real gate for who sees the Settings Apple Health panel and the re-prompt banner. Currently just Dean.

### Gotchas codified

1. **Capgo plugin emits lowerCamelCase workout_type on iOS.** Server-side taxonomy matching must normalise (lowercase + strip non-alphanumerics) both sides of a set-membership check. Do not rely on Apple's UpperCamelCase enum names matching what the plugin actually sends.

2. **`plugin.querySamples()` does not exist in Capgo 8.4.7.** The method is `plugin.readSamples()`. Session 4 codified the method list; this entry codifies the cost of not patching the client to match (6 silent type-drops from Session 4 ship until today).

3. **State caches with short TTLs cannot be the source of truth for durable membership gates.** "Has this user ever connected" needs either a persistent localStorage flag or server-authoritative state — never a 10-minute state cache. The banner gate in 5b is the persistent-flag fix; 5c is the server-authoritative one.

4. **`readSamples` exposes the HealthKit UUID as `platformId`, not `id` or `uuid`.** Add it to any `native_uuid` fallback chain. Otherwise the synthetic fallback produces a new UUID on every re-pull, which breaks the shadow-read guard on re-ingestion.

5. **`member-dashboard` v50's `health_connections` response shape uses `is_revoked: boolean`, not the raw table's `revoked_at: timestamptz | null`.** EF-shape ≠ table-shape. Hydration consumers check the transformed field.

6. **"Sync completed successfully" is not the same as "promotion happened".** EF v1's `last_sync_status: ok` was returned even when `promoted` counts were all zero. Future EF work should surface promotion outcomes more prominently (or fail the sync status when promotion fails), and any time an on-device sync is described as "complete", the verification is checking `member_health_samples.promoted_to` counts, not just the connection row.

### Outstanding for the rest of session 5

- **Write-path round-trip on-device.** Dean to log a weight on nutrition.html, verify `member_health_write_ledger` goes queued → confirmed with a real HealthKit `native_uuid`, next sync filters that UUID out of the shadow-read, re-logging same day updates `weight_logs` in place rather than duplicating.
- **Verify the `readSamples` fix lands six new sample types on Dean's next on-device sync.** Spot-check `member_health_samples.sample_type` counts after sync.
- **Consent-gate + re-prompt banner flow test with a fresh test account.** Carried over from Session 4's outstanding list — still needs a new signup in a clean session.
- **Rollout plan.** Paper decisions: Alan first, then cohort of ~5 paying members, rollback = EF v51 with reduced `HEALTH_FEATURE_ALLOWLIST`, member comms strategy. Not worth broadening past Dean's circle before the App Store build is live.
- **Privacy.html HealthKit section + App Store Connect questionnaire + Build 3 submission.** Needs Lewis on the copy. Plan doc has the outline.
- **Decide submission scope.** Plan's risk register flagged "Apple rejects on broad 7-scope request" as Medium. Either submit all 7 and react to rejection, or preemptively phase to 4 (workouts + weight + steps + active_energy) with HR/sleep/distance in v1.1. Conservative path saves a ~1-week rejection loop against the May deadline.

## 2026-04-23 — Portal outage & recovery: defer-on-auth TypeError, then SDK-before-ready RLS strip (two bugs, one evening)

Fixing a ~500ms blank-screen perf issue this afternoon led to a two-stage portal outage on 17 paying members and ~90 minutes of wrong-hypothesis debugging before the real cause was read directly from the code. Root-causing is captured here so the pattern doesn't repeat.

### Bug A — [14a3540] defer on auth.js broke inline body scripts

The 4:53pm perf commit added `<script src="/theme.js" defer></script>` and `<script src="auth.js" defer></script>` across 14 portal HTML files, plus `<link rel="preconnect">` and `<link rel="preload" as="script" href="/supabase.min.js">` in each head. The intent was to unblock the HTML parser so the page could render faster. The failure mode: inline `<script>` blocks in the body (habits.html, index.html and others) instantiate their own helpers that read from `auth.js` globals — `window.vyveSupabase`, `window.vyveCurrentUser`, the shared `supa()` pattern — and dispatch `vyveAuthReady` listeners. Deferred scripts run **after** the inline body scripts, not before, so every inline block ran against an undefined `auth.js` surface and threw `TypeError`s. Console lit up red on every portal page.

**Fix [25a7859] at 10:36pm:** reverted just the `defer` attribute on `auth.js` across all 14 files. Kept `defer` on `theme.js`, `nav.js`, `offline-manager.js` since nothing inline depends on them before DOMContentLoaded. Kept the `preconnect` and `preload` hints. SW bumped to `v2026-04-23j-authjs-blocking`.

### Bug B — [b7291b9] optimistic fast-path dispatched vyveAuthReady before window.vyveSupabase existed

With Bug A cleared, the console went clean but habits.html and the index dashboard counters stayed empty. 90 minutes were lost chasing missing foreign keys and schema corruption — every hypothesis was wrong because none was grounded in reading the actual code. What the code showed, once properly read: commit b7291b9 (the 5:08pm optimistic-auth-fast-path perf commit) had restructured `vyveInitAuth()` so the fast-path reveal happens BEFORE `await vyveLoadSupabaseSDK()`. Sequence on the live portal was:

1. `DOMContentLoaded` fires → `vyveInitAuth()` starts
2. Fast-path reads cached session from `localStorage.vyve_auth`, builds user object, sets `window.vyveCurrentUser`, dispatches `vyveAuthReady` — all synchronously
3. Pages' inline body scripts (attached via `waitForAuth`) fire their load function, which calls `supa('/member_habits?...')`
4. `supa()` checks `window.vyveSupabase` — still undefined because step 5 has not run yet — falls back to anon key as the Bearer token
5. `await vyveLoadSupabaseSDK()` finally runs, client created, `window.vyveSupabase` assigned — too late

PostgREST accepted the request (`apikey` header was valid) and returned `200 OK`. But `auth.email()` evaluated to NULL on the DB, so the RLS policy `(member_email = auth.email())` filtered every row out. Response body: `[]` — 2 bytes plus headers, which is exactly the "0.5 kB" seen in the Network tab. Verified empirically from the debug session by firing the same URL with `apikey=ANON`/`Authorization: Bearer ANON` and observing `200 []`.

This bug had been latent since b7291b9 shipped but was masked by Bug A's TypeErrors — the fast-path code never actually executed cleanly until 25a7859 unblocked it.

**Fix [802dd87] at 11:54pm:** moved the SDK load, client creation, `window.vyveSupabase` assignment, sign-out wiring and `onAuthStateChange` listener to BEFORE the fast-path reveal block in `vyveInitAuth`. The fast path still fires synchronously from the cached session, but now `window.vyveSupabase` is guaranteed live when `vyveAuthReady` dispatches. Cost: `await vyveLoadSupabaseSDK()` now runs before app reveal instead of after, adding ~20-50ms to first paint (`supabase.min.js` is preloaded in every page head via the 14a3540 `<link rel=preload>` that survived the revert, so it's near-instant). Well worth it vs silent empty data. SW bumped to `v2026-04-23k-sdk-before-ready`.

### Process lessons

1. **Read the code, don't theorise.** The 90-minute detour on FK/schema hypotheses happened because of pattern-matching ("empty response → broken DB") instead of reading what the `supa()` helper actually does when `window.vyveSupabase` is unset. The full `vyveInitAuth` body + the habits.html `supa()` definition gave the diagnosis in under five minutes once actually looked at.
2. **A 200 + tiny response body is not proof of a working query.** Under RLS, an empty-filter match returns `200 []` indistinguishable from a successful-but-empty query. Always cross-check with a service-role query against the same predicates — which is how we confirmed Dean had 7 rows in `member_habits` while the PWA saw zero.
3. **Perf changes that touch script ordering or auth flow must be validated on a RLS-protected query path, not just by "app rendered".** Both b7291b9 and 14a3540 would have failed a habits-renders-data smoketest; neither was run before ship.

### State of play

**vyve-site latest: [802dd87]** (main). SW cache: `v2026-04-23k-sdk-before-ready`. Portal back to working for 17 paying members. Both perf wins from today (preload/preconnect hints + optimistic auth fast-path) are preserved — only the execution order in `vyveInitAuth` was corrected. No HTML changes in the final fix beyond the two patches already landed in 25a7859.

### Gotchas codified for Hard Rules

1. **window.vyveSupabase MUST exist before vyveAuthReady fires.** Any restructuring of `vyveInitAuth` must preserve this invariant. The SDK load is cheap (preloaded) — never trade this invariant for the 20ms it saves.
2. **Do not add `defer` to `auth.js`.** Inline body scripts across 14 pages depend on auth.js globals being available by the time the parser reaches them. `theme.js`, `nav.js`, `offline-manager.js` are defer-safe; `auth.js` is not without a proper ready-promise refactor (tracked in backlog).
3. **When debugging an apparently-empty PostgREST response, first check whether the Bearer token is an anon key vs a member JWT.** The anon path is a silent RLS strip, not a visible auth failure.

## 2026-04-23 — HealthKit session 4: iOS device validation, 4 plugin debugging iterations, full UX overhaul, end-to-end sync working

First real-device validation of the Capgo HealthKit integration on Dean's iPhone 15 Pro Max, plus one-time Xcode/signing setup, four atomic plugin-taxonomy fixes discovered from Safari Web Inspector on a live WKWebView session, a complete UX pivot to Apple-native consent patterns, and full end-to-end validation of Health data syncing into Supabase.

### One-time Xcode and signing setup

Installed Xcode 26.4.1 from App Store, opened `~/Projects/vyve-capacitor` via `npx cap open ios`, enabled automatic signing against VYVE Health CIC team (VPW62W696B) using Lewis Vines' Apple ID. Generated Apple Development certificate (Lewis Vines: Z6474RNZZB), registered iPhone 15 Pro Max UDID to the dev team, enabled Developer Mode on the phone. Bundle ID `co.uk.vyvehealth.app`, iOS 15.0 min target, HealthKit capability present (Clinical Health Records OFF, Background Delivery OFF — neither needed for MVP). App installed and launched successfully on device. This is a one-time setup — future releases use Product → Archive with the same automatic signing, and the existing App Store distribution profile remains intact.

### Four plugin debugging iterations

On first device launch, the Settings page Apple Health toggle was dead — tapping threw `ReferenceError: handleAppleHealthToggle is not defined`. Four root causes surfaced, each shipped as its own atomic commit against vyve-site.

**[88c69b5] settings.html script-tag scope trap fix.** Session 3.1 had already codified this gotcha in the brain, but the original session 3 push had left the damage in place: the HealthKit JS block (hbInitSettings, hbRefreshStatus, handleAppleHealthToggle, hbSyncNow, waitForHealthBridge IIFE) was injected between `<script src="/nav.js" defer>` and its closing `</script>`. Per HTML spec, inline body of a script tag with a src attribute is discarded entirely — all five symbols silently evaporated. Fix: closed the nav.js tag and opened a fresh `<script>` for the HealthKit block. Script tag balance restored from 6/6 to 7/7. `sw` bumped to `v2026-04-23e-settings-fix`.

**[e127541] healthbridge.js plugin name lookup fix.** Even with JS now defined, `requestAuthorization` still failed silently. A diagnostic `console.log(Object.keys(window.Capacitor.Plugins))` on the live WebView revealed the plugin registers as `window.Capacitor.Plugins.Health` on Capgo 8.4.7 iOS — not `CapacitorHealth` or `CapgoCapacitorHealth` as the Capgo README examples and most community snippets suggest. Fix: `getPlugin()` now defensively checks all three names: `plugins.Health || plugins.CapacitorHealth || plugins.CapgoCapacitorHealth`. `sw` bumped to `v2026-04-23f-plugin-name`.

**[ec0a7b9] Scope rename activeCaloriesBurned → calories.** After plugin resolved, permission sheet requests failed with an unrecognised-type error. Inspected `Cap-go/capacitor-health/ios/Sources/HealthPlugin/Health.swift` source: the iOS `HealthDataType` enum uses `calories` (which the plugin maps internally to `HKQuantityTypeIdentifier.activeEnergyBurned`), not the iOS-native name `activeCaloriesBurned`. Patched both `DEFAULT_READ_SCOPES` and the sample-pull type map in healthbridge.js. `sw` bumped to `v2026-04-23g-scope-rename`.

**[19d0fd1] Drop `workouts` from WRITE scopes + UI copy update.** With reads fixed, writes still threw. Deeper Swift-source inspection showed `requestAuthorization` uses two different parsers: `parseTypesWithWorkouts` for reads (which special-cases "workouts") and `parseMany` for writes (which throws on "workouts" because it is not in the HealthDataType enum at all). The plugin exposes no `saveWorkout` method — only `saveSample` for quantity/category types. Workouts write-back is not supported by Capgo 8.4.7 on iOS, period. Fix: `DEFAULT_WRITE_SCOPES = ['weight']` only. Removed "Workouts you complete in VYVE" from the settings.html UI copy and updated the toggle subtitle from "Read workouts, write back to Health app" → "Read health data, write back your weight". `sw` bumped to `v2026-04-23h-workouts-read-only`.

### End-to-end validation

After the fourth fix deployed, the full flow worked first time. Toggled Apple Health on in Settings → native iOS HealthKit permission sheet appeared listing all 7 data types → Dean approved → `requestAuthorization` succeeded → `connect()` wrote `member_health_connections` row → Settings page updated to "Synced just now" with all 9 UI data-type rows shown (Workouts & exercise sessions, Steps, Activity, Energy, Calories, Heart rate, Weight, Sleep analysis, Distance).

### Capgo plugin 8.4.7 taxonomy (codified — hard reference for session 5+)

Valid `HealthDataType` enum (from `Cap-go/capacitor-health` Swift source): `steps, distance, calories, heartRate, weight, respiratoryRate, oxygenSaturation, restingHeartRate, heartRateVariability, bloodGlucose, bodyTemperature, height, flightsClimbed, exerciseTime, distanceCycling, bodyFat, basalBodyTemperature, basalCalories, totalCalories, sleep, bloodPressure, mindfulness`. Note: `workouts` is NOT in the enum — it is handled specially via `parseTypesWithWorkouts` in the READ path only. Plugin registers as `window.Capacitor.Plugins.Health`. Exposed methods: `isAvailable, requestAuthorization, checkAuthorization, readSamples, saveSample, getPluginVersion, openHealthConnectSettings, showPrivacyPolicy, queryWorkouts, queryAggregated`. No `saveWorkout`. No arbitrary sample types.

### Currently active scopes

Reads (7): `steps, workouts, heartRate, weight, calories, sleep, distance`. Writes (1): `weight` only.

Available-but-not-yet-wired (parked for post-sell session 5+ enhancement): `restingHeartRate, heartRateVariability, exerciseTime, mindfulness`. Simple one-line additions to `DEFAULT_READ_SCOPES` plus the sample-pull mapping in healthbridge.js when we want them.

### Session 4.5: UX overhaul to Apple-native patterns

Mid-session pivot on Dean's direction: the original toggle-based UX (toggle connects / toggle disconnects in-app) was wrong for iOS. Apple's expected pattern is: the app asks once, permission is then sticky and managed exclusively via iPhone Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices. In-app disconnect is discouraged and confusing because iOS permissions can only truly be revoked at the OS level. Also added a re-prompt path for users who declined at onboarding.

Shipped as a single atomic commit **[612459b]** across 4 files:

**consent-gate.html.** Added a new 4th card "Connect Apple Health" shown only when `window.Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'ios'`. State object extended with `applehealth: false`. On Continue: writes consent row as before, then if applehealth was ticked, calls `healthBridge.connect()` — fails silently since consent is already saved (non-fatal). If applehealth was not ticked on native, sets `localStorage.vyve_healthkit_declined_at = Date.now()` to start the 7-day cooldown. Also auto-sets `vyve_healthkit_dev='1'` if not present (future-proofing for server allowlist rollout). healthbridge.js script tag added. 18098 bytes.

**settings.html.** `hbRefreshStatus` and `handleAppleHealthToggle` rewritten connect-only. When connected: `toggle.disabled = true`, `toggle.checked = true`, toggle locks on, new muted `#hb-manage-note` appears: "To disconnect, open iPhone Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices → VYVE Health". When not connected: toggle is interactive to trigger connect, note hidden. `handleAppleHealthToggle(false)` path is now a no-op that just re-snaps the toggle to off — once disabled, this path is unreachable from the UI anyway. 75881 bytes.

**index.html.** Pink gradient re-prompt banner `#hb-reprompt-banner` injected at top of `<main>`. Shown only if: (1) native iOS Capacitor detected, (2) healthBridge feature flag enabled, (3) not currently connected per `getState()`, (4) declined at least 7 days ago (or declined marker absent entirely — shows once for members who never saw consent-gate). "Connect" fires `healthBridge.connect()` and clears the declined marker on success. "Not now" re-stamps `declined_at` to Now, resetting the 7-day window. Guard via `waitForCapacitor` polling so the banner doesn't initialise before the Capacitor bridge is available. 88493 bytes.

**sw.js.** Cache bumped to `v2026-04-23i-apple-health-flow`.

### Validation of settings.html UX fix

First reload after 612459b deploy, the Settings page was still letting Dean toggle Apple Health off. Safari Web Inspector diagnostic from the device showed `getState()` correctly returning `connected: true` with all 7 granted scopes, but `toggle.disabled: false` — the new `hbRefreshStatus` code wasn't running. Cause: service worker was serving stale settings.html from cache despite force-quit. Flushed via console script that unregistered all SW registrations and deleted all caches, then `location.reload(true)`. Post-reload: `hb-manage-note element exists: true`, toggle locked on green, cannot be turned off. Validated.

### State of play

**vyve-site latest: [612459b]** (main). **VYVEBrain latest: this entry.** SW cache: `v2026-04-23i-apple-health-flow`. 7 native iOS scopes reading into Supabase, 1 writing, member_health_connections row verified present for Dean's account, initial 30-day historical pull completed.

### Gotchas codified for Hard Rules

1. **Never inject inline JS between `<script src="...">` and its `</script>`** — body is discarded by spec. Always close the src tag first and open a fresh `<script>` for the inline block. Script tag balance audit after any HTML patch involving scripts.
2. **Capgo plugin iOS registers as `window.Capacitor.Plugins.Health`** (not CapacitorHealth, not CapgoCapacitorHealth). Always check all three names defensively: `plugins.Health || plugins.CapacitorHealth || plugins.CapgoCapacitorHealth`.
3. **Capgo 8.4.7 iOS: `workouts` is valid for READS only** (via `parseTypesWithWorkouts`). NOT valid for writes. No `saveWorkout` method exposed at all. Only `saveSample` for quantity/category types.
4. **iOS Capacitor WebView `navigator.serviceWorker` is often undefined** — `getRegistrations()` throws TypeError on some iOS WKWebView builds. Don't rely on SW unregister on native; if cache-flush needed, force-quit app or offload+reinstall.
5. **`location.reload()` in WKWebView doesn't always bypass the URL cache** even with `?v=timestamp`. Fresh in-memory JS modules require full app kill+relaunch. When that fails too, the console `caches.keys()` + `caches.delete()` + SW unregister combo works.
6. **First device-side build requires one-time dev certificate + device UDID registration** to the developer team (separate from App Store distribution profile). App Store distribution profile remains intact. For future releases use Product → Archive with automatic signing.

### Outstanding for session 5

- Verify initial 30-day pull populated `member_health_samples` correctly (spot-check row counts per scope for Dean's account).
- Full consent-gate + re-prompt banner flow test with a fresh test account (requires new sign-up — parked, not to be done in the same session as other paid testing).
- Potential addition of 4 extra read scopes: `restingHeartRate, heartRateVariability, exerciseTime, mindfulness`.
- Android Health Connect parity work.
- HAVEN clinical sign-off from Phil (separate workstream).
- Server allowlist auto-populate from member-dashboard v50 so the feature flag can be rolled to real members without requiring `localStorage.vyve_healthkit_dev='1'`.

## 2026-04-23 — HealthKit session 3.1 bugfix: script-tag scope trap in settings.html

Mid-preview of session 3's Settings UI (still feature-flagged to Dean's localStorage dev flag only, zero production impact), the Apple Health card stayed `display:none` even with the flag set and — when forced visible — the toggle threw `ReferenceError: handleAppleHealthToggle is not defined`.

### Root cause

In session 3's patch, the HealthKit JS block (hbInitSettings, hbRefreshStatus, handleAppleHealthToggle, hbSyncNow, waitForHealthBridge IIFE) was inserted between the opening `<script src="/nav.js" defer>` and its `</script>`. Per the HTML spec, when a `<script>` element has a `src` attribute, any inline body between the tags is **ignored** — the browser only executes the external file. All five HealthKit symbols were silently dropped at parse time. This single mis-injection unified every symptom:
- No `hbInitSettings` ran → section stayed hidden on page load
- No `handleAppleHealthToggle` defined → inline `onchange=` threw ReferenceError
- `location.reload()` didn't help — the init code never existed to run
- Manual `style.display = ''` worked cosmetically because the DOM was fine; only the JS was missing

### Fix

One-byte edit in `settings.html`: close the nav.js script tag on the same line, open a fresh `<script>` for the HealthKit block.

Before:
```
<script src="/nav.js" defer>
// ─── HealthKit integration ...
function hbInitSettings() { ... }
...
</script>
```

After:
```
<script src="/nav.js" defer></script>
<script>
// ─── HealthKit integration ...
function hbInitSettings() { ... }
...
</script>
```

Script-tag balance before/after the patch: 6/6 → 7/7. `<script src=...>` tags now self-close.

### Verification

On Chrome web preview (deanonbrown@hotmail.com, localStorage flag set):
- SW re-registered on `vyve-cache-v2026-04-23e-settings-fix`
- Apple Health section auto-renders on page load (no manual CSS override)
- Clicking the toggle fires `handleAppleHealthToggle(true)` → `healthBridge.connect()` → `{ error: 'web_unsupported' }` → alert: "Could not connect to Apple Health: web_unsupported"
- Expected and correct behaviour for web. Native iOS call path will replace `web_unsupported` with the real HealthKit permission sheet in session 4.

### Gotcha codified (add to Hard Rules)

**Never inject inline JS between `<script src="...">` and its `</script>`.** When a script tag has a `src` attribute, the body is discarded — symptoms look like "functions inexplicably missing at runtime". Always wrap inline code in its own separate `<script>` tag.

- Brain: this entry

### Session 4 still gated on Xcode

No change — Xcode install in progress on Dean's Mac. Once done: `npx cap open ios`, build to iPhone 15 Pro Max, open Settings via native app, native HealthKit permission sheet should appear on toggle, then plugin → server → sync flow completes the device-side validation of session 1's migration + session 2's plugin install + session 3's client orchestrator.

---

## 2026-04-23 — HealthKit session 2 partial + session 3 full: plugin installed, client orchestrator live (feature-flagged)

Parallel push: session 2 pre-work on Dean's Mac while Xcode installs, session 3 shipped in full. Xcode install blocks the final device test of session 2; sessions 4–6 wait on that.

### Session 2 progress

**What's done (pre-device-test):**
- `@capgo/capacitor-health@8.4.7` installed via `npm install @capgo/capacitor-health` in `~/Projects/vyve-capacitor`
- `npx cap sync ios` wired the plugin into the native iOS Capacitor project via SPM (Package.swift manifest confirms `.package(name: "CapgoCapacitorHealth", path: "../../../node_modules/@capgo/capacitor-health")`)
- Info.plist upgraded: both `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` and `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription` rewritten from generic copy to feature-named, guideline-5.1.3-defensible language. Backup preserved at `ios/App/App/Info.plist.bak.pre-healthkit`
- `App.entitlements` already had `com.apple.developer.healthkit: true` from a prior setup
- `capacitor.config.json` confirmed: appId `co.uk.vyvehealth.app`, server URL `https://online.vyvehealth.co.uk`

**What's blocking:**
- Xcode not installed on Dean's Mac (discovered mid-session). Installing now, ~30–60 min download. Required for the device-side plugin permission/read/write test.

**Pre-reqs fully confirmed:**
- HealthKit entitlement enabled on App ID (`co.uk.vyvehealth.app`) in Apple Developer portal
- Sub-capabilities: Clinical Health Records OFF, Background Delivery OFF
- Distribution provisioning profile regenerated
- Test devices: iPhone 15 Pro Max + Apple Watch Ultra (highest-fidelity HealthKit combo)

### Session 3 — client orchestrator + Settings UI (SHIPPED)

**Scope decision** — session 3 ran in parallel with Xcode download because the code is platform-agnostic. Feature-flag gate means zero production risk.

**NEW: `healthbridge.js`** (478 lines, 18.4KB at `vyve-site/healthbridge.js`) — the client orchestrator that bridges `@capgo/capacitor-health` ↔ `sync-health-data` EF.

Public API (`window.healthBridge`):
- `isFeatureEnabled()` — gate; returns true only if `localStorage.vyve_healthkit_dev === '1'` OR `window.__VYVE_HEALTH_FEATURE_ALLOWED__ === true`
- `isNative()` — Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'ios' | 'android'
- `connect()` — requests plugin authorization (7 read + 2 write scopes), upserts connection row via EF, pulls initial 30-day window
- `disconnect()` — marks connection revoked server-side (iOS can't revoke programmatically)
- `sync(opts)` — chunked pull (batch size 500) + promotion; flushes any pending write-ledger entries via `writeSample` / `writeWorkout` then `confirm_write` action
- `maybeAutoSync()` — auto-runs on `visibilitychange` if last sync > 60 min ago
- `flushAfterLocalWrite()` — called from workouts.html / nutrition.html after local activity, flushes write-ledger queue immediately

Default scopes requested: `steps, workouts, heartRate, weight, activeCaloriesBurned, sleep, distance` (reads) + `weight, workouts` (writes).

**Scope-name translation:** plugin's dataType names don't match the server's `granted_scopes` semantics. Write scopes are sent to server as `write_weight` and `write_workouts` specifically because `queue_health_write_back()` in session 1's migration checks `'write_workouts' = any(granted_scopes)` to decide whether to queue.

**Settings UI** — `settings.html` had a stub APPLE HEALTH section calling `window.VYVENative.requestHealthKit()` (undefined). Replaced with:
- Section wrapped with `id="hb-section" style="display:none"` — invisible until feature flag is on
- `handleAppleHealthToggle(enabled)` now calls `healthBridge.connect()` / `healthBridge.disconnect()`
- Added `hbSyncNow()` button for manual resync when connected
- Added `hbRefreshStatus()` which shows "Synced N min ago" or "Connected — not synced yet"
- Upgraded data-type copy to match actual 7-read/2-write scopes with revocation instructions (iPhone Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices → VYVE Health)

**Script injection** — `healthbridge.js` loaded after `auth.js` on all 4 relevant pages: settings.html, index.html, workouts.html, nutrition.html. Tag balance verified on each via `<script` vs `</script>` count.

**Service worker cache bump** — `sw.js` v2026-04-23c-cache-first → v2026-04-23d-healthbridge (Hard Rule 5 — JS asset changes still require bump).

**NEW EF: `member-dashboard` v50** — additive patch to v49. One extra parallel query (`member_health_connections`), one allowlist constant (`HEALTH_FEATURE_ALLOWLIST`, currently just `deanonbrown@hotmail.com`), two new response fields: `health_feature_allowed` (boolean) and `health_connections` (array). verify_jwt remains false at platform level (Rule 21 preserved). Smoketest of v50 confirmed 11-key response shape vs v49's 9-key, no breakage of existing fields.

### Feature-flag status and why it's safe

**Dev flag is the only active gate in session 3.** Set via Safari Web Inspector: `localStorage.vyve_healthkit_dev = '1'`, then reload. Nobody else has this set.

**Server allowlist is wired into v50 but NOT yet pushed to `window.__VYVE_HEALTH_FEATURE_ALLOWED__`.** To do so, one of two things is needed and sits in the session 4 scope:
- Option A: `auth.js` on login reads `health_feature_allowed` from `member-dashboard` and sets the global
- Option B: Each page that cares (settings.html) fetches the dashboard and sets it inline before `hbInitSettings()` runs

Either way, zero production members currently see any UI change:
- All 17 production members will fail `isFeatureEnabled()` → `hb-section` stays `display:none`
- Only Dean can toggle his own localStorage dev flag on his iPhone

### Smoketest results

| Layer | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| member-dashboard v50 | Deploy: status=ACTIVE version=50 verify_jwt=false | ✅ |
| member-dashboard v50 | Smoketest with fresh test user returns 11 keys incl. `health_feature_allowed` + `health_connections` | ✅ |
| member-dashboard v50 | `health_feature_allowed: false` for non-Dean user | ✅ |
| member-dashboard v50 | `health_connections: []` empty array for user with no connection row | ✅ |
| member-dashboard v50 | Existing 9 response keys untouched | ✅ |
| settings.html | Script tag balance 6/6 `<script>` vs `</script>` | ✅ |
| index.html | Script tag balance 12/12 | ✅ |
| workouts.html | Script tag balance 13/13 | ✅ |
| nutrition.html | Script tag balance 8/8 | ✅ |
| healthbridge.js | Gated on `isFeatureEnabled()` AND `isNative()` — no-op on web | ✅ (by design) |

### Gotchas codified

1. **Plugin exposure name** — under Capacitor 8, the plugin is exposed as `window.Capacitor.Plugins.CapacitorHealth`. Some plugin versions use `CapgoCapacitorHealth`. healthbridge.js checks both. Confirmed at runtime in session 4 with the real plugin build.
2. **iOS doesn't expose actual granted scopes** — `requestAuthorization()` returns without telling you which scopes the user actually approved. Plugin design decision: we assume all requested scopes granted and let subsequent `querySamples()` / `writeSample()` calls fail naturally for denied ones. Server records requested scopes in `granted_scopes[]`; write-ledger queue will silently fail-to-write for denied scopes (and the `confirm_write` action marks them `failed`).
3. **iOS has no programmatic disconnect API** — `healthBridge.disconnect()` only updates server state and local cache; to fully revoke, user must go to iPhone Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices → VYVE Health. Settings UI says so explicitly.
4. **Script-tag injection pattern varies across pages** — settings.html uses `<script src="/auth.js" defer></script>`, index.html / workouts.html / nutrition.html use `<script src="auth.js" defer></script>` (no leading slash). Patch logic tried both variants.

### Commits

- Supabase: `member-dashboard` v50 deployed ACTIVE
- vyve-site: [e63da07](https://github.com/VYVEHealth/vyve-site/commit/e63da07b54d3b3ec4fdc9ae5eb32c04a6aaee79b) — 6 files
- Brain: this entry + backlog update + snapshot of EF v50 source

### Next session

**Session 4** — iOS device test + write-path validation (requires Xcode installed).
- Build to iPhone 15 Pro Max via Xcode
- Trigger `healthBridge.connect()` via Safari Web Inspector console
- Confirm permission sheet shows our new long-form Info.plist copy
- Read a real workout from Apple Watch Ultra, see it appear in `member_health_samples` and promoted to `workouts`
- Write a test weight, confirm it appears in Apple Health with source "VYVE Health", confirm next sync doesn't double-count it via the write-ledger shadow-read filter
- Wire `window.__VYVE_HEALTH_FEATURE_ALLOWED__` from `member-dashboard` response so the allowlist is automatic (Dean gets the Settings UI without the localStorage dev flag)

## 2026-04-23 — HealthKit session 1: DB foundation + sync-health-data EF v1 ACTIVE

### What shipped

**Supabase migrations (two idempotent applies):**
- `healthkit_health_connect_foundation` — 3 tables, 11 indexes, `queue_health_write_back()` function, 2 auto-queue triggers on `workouts` + `weight_logs`, 3 RLS policies (self-select only)
- `healthkit_lc_email_triggers` — `zz_lc_email` triggers on all 3 new tables (initial migration's trigger statements silently failed to apply — the known `SUPABASE_APPLY_A_MIGRATION` partial-success gotcha)

**Edge Function `sync-health-data` v1** — status ACTIVE, `verify_jwt: false` (VYVE Rule 21), CORS locked to `online.vyvehealth.co.uk`, ID `1b0d57b9-cbd2-4d6c-86e8-796bc9b42e4a`. 484 lines. Three actions:
- `pull_samples` — client POSTs batch of device health samples. EF upserts connection row, filters shadow-reads against confirmed write-ledger, runs outlier gate (workout > 12h, weight outside 20-400kg, HR > 250bpm, steps > 200k/day, distance > 300km/event), rejects samples older than 60 days, batches dedup-insert into `member_health_samples`, promotes to `workouts`/`cardio`/`weight_logs` per mapping table, returns `pending_writes` list for client flush.
- `confirm_write` — client confirms write-ledger entry succeeded (or failed) with native UUID. Defence-in-depth: only the owning member can confirm.
- `mark_revoked` — marks `member_health_connections` revoked; turns off auto-queue of writes via the trigger's `revoked_at is null` filter.

### New Supabase tables

| Table | Purpose | Key invariant |
|---|---|---|
| `member_health_samples` | Raw samples from device. dedup via `unique (member_email, source, native_uuid)` | Writes only via EF (service role); self-select RLS |
| `member_health_connections` | Per-member per-platform consent state. `primary key (member_email, platform)` | Platform-level enum; `granted_scopes` text[] |
| `member_health_write_ledger` | VYVE→native write queue + shadow-read guard | `unique (platform, vyve_source_table, vyve_source_id)`; `native_uuid` populated on client confirm |

### Promotion mapping (implemented inside EF)

- **weight** → `weight_logs` (upsert on `member_email, logged_date`)
- **workout** + type in strength set (FST/TST/Core/Pilates/Crosstraining/long Yoga ≥30min) → `workouts`
- **workout** + type in cardio set (Running/Cycling/Walking/Hiking/Rowing/Swimming/HIIT/Elliptical/StairClimbing/MixedCardio) → `cardio`  (extracts `metadata.distance_m` → `distance_km`)
- **workout** short Yoga (<30min) → raw-only (treat as mobility, future Wearable Insights panel)
- **steps**, **heart_rate**, **active_energy**, **sleep**, **distance** → raw-only in v1

### Smoketest results (3-layer, same pattern as Shell 3 Sub-scope A)

| Layer | Tests | Passed |
|---|---|---|
| Deploy | EF ACTIVE, verify_jwt:false, version=1 | ✅ |
| HTTP | OPTIONS→200 with CORS, GET→405, unknown action→400, invalid platform→400, no auth→401, bad JWT→401 | ✅ (6/6) |
| DB | Empty pull upserts connection; 7/10 samples inserted (3 rejected via outlier+too_old); weight→weight_logs promoted; workouts→workouts + cardio→cardio promoted once FK satisfied; re-sending same batch dedups cleanly; confirm_write transitions status to 'confirmed' with native_uuid; shadow-read filter rejects samples whose native_uuid is already in the ledger; confirm_write with error_message → 'failed'; mark_revoked sets revoked_at; ownership guard: confirm_write with random ledger_id → 404 | ✅ (22/24) |

Two nominal "failures" in summary are from the pre-members-row batch — test user existed in `auth.users` but not yet in `public.members`, so workouts/cardio FK-violated and went to `skipped_cap`. In production every `auth.users` row also has a `members` row (set up by `onboarding` EF v57+), so this is a smoketest-setup artefact, not a bug. Re-ran the same batch post-members-insert and all promotions worked.

All smoketest artefacts cleaned up (0 samples, 0 connections, 0 ledger rows, 0 workouts/cardio/weight/members/platform_alerts tied to smoketest email).

### Gotchas found this session (candidates for master.md update)

1. **`SUPABASE_APPLY_A_MIGRATION` silent partial apply** — confirmed brain rule. The `zz_lc_email` triggers in the initial migration statement block didn't land even though the apply returned success. Caught by pg_trigger verification. Fix: always verify multi-statement migrations via pg_class joins (not `tgrelid::regclass::text like …`) after apply.
2. **`regclass::text` is unreliable for trigger lookup** — returns unqualified name when relation is in search_path, breaks naive LIKE filters. Use `pg_trigger JOIN pg_class JOIN pg_namespace` instead.
3. **`workouts` and `cardio` have FK to `members.email` ON DELETE CASCADE** (weight_logs does not). Any test account in `auth.users` needs a paired `public.members` row for INSERT paths to work. Not documented in master.md §4 DB inventory.
4. **`workouts.session_number` and `cardio.session_number` are CHECK-constrained to (1,2)** — matches the 2/day cap. `workouts.time_of_day` is CHECK-constrained to (morning|afternoon|evening|night). EF uses correct values for both.
5. **`platform_alerts` schema** uses `type` (not `alert_type`), `details` (not `message`), no `metadata` column. Initial EF source had the wrong names; corrected before deploy.

### Next session (session 2)

iOS Capacitor plugin + Info.plist + Xcode HealthKit capability + real-device permission flow. Pre-req confirmed: HealthKit entitlement enabled on App ID, sub-capabilities both OFF, provisioning profile regenerated. Dean has iPhone 15 Pro Max + Apple Watch Ultra for testing.

### Commits

- Supabase: migrations `healthkit_health_connect_foundation` + `healthkit_lc_email_triggers`; EF `sync-health-data` v1 deployed
- Brain: this entry + backlog update

## 2026-04-23 — Plan mapped: HealthKit + Health Connect integration (iOS-first)

### Context
Dean asked to map how we ship HealthKit (iOS) and Health Connect (Android) wearable integration. Scope resolved in conversation; full plan committed to `plans/healthkit-health-connect.md`.

### Scope decisions locked
- **Read + write workouts and weight. No cardio write** (distance/calorie accuracy not defensible to Apple review when we only capture duration).
- **All 7 data types in v1:** workouts, steps, heart rate, weight, active energy, sleep, distance. Fallback split-phase plan held in reserve if Apple rejects on scope breadth.
- **iOS first.** Dean has iPhone + Apple Watch. No Android test device yet — Android becomes a ~4-session follow-up once device acquired. Keeps May sell-ready target intact (Sage will demo on iPhone regardless).
- **Plugin: `@capgo/capacitor-health`.** Only free unified plugin covering modern HealthKit + Health Connect (not deprecated Google Fit). MIT licensed, active maintenance.
- **Background delivery on iOS deferred to v2** — needs Swift plugin extension, out of scope.

### Architecture
- Client-side `healthbridge.js` (~350 lines) orchestrates `@capgo/capacitor-health` + Supabase round-trips
- Server-side `sync-health-data` EF v1 handles ingest, dedup, promotion, and write-ledger confirmation
- Three new Supabase tables: `member_health_samples` (raw, dedup by native_uuid), `member_health_connections` (per-platform consent state), `member_health_write_ledger` (solves shadow-read: prevents the "write workout → HK → next sync pulls it back → duplicate promotion" bug)
- Existing cap triggers (Rule 34) handle over-cap routing to `activity_dedupe` for no extra logic
- Two DB triggers on `workouts` and `weight_logs` auto-queue write-back when member has write scope

### Session plan (iOS)
1. DB + EF foundation (smoketest with synthetic data, nothing member-visible)
2. iOS plugin install + Info.plist + Xcode HealthKit capability — pre-req: HealthKit entitlement on Apple Dev portal
3. `healthbridge.js` + Settings UI + read-path integration with workouts.html/cardio.html
4. Write-path integration + ledger dedup validation (round-trip test)
5. Privacy page update + App Privacy questionnaire + App Store Build 3 submission
6. Apple review response + launch (3–7 day calendar for review)

Total: 6 sessions, ~2 weeks calendar time.

### Dean's pre-session-2 homework
- Confirm HealthKit entitlement on Apple Developer portal (`developer.apple.com/account` → Identifiers → VYVE App ID → Capabilities → HealthKit). Regenerate distribution provisioning profile after enabling. Full steps in today's conversation.
- Confirm iPhone model + iOS version, Apple Watch model + watchOS version for session 2 testing.

### Risks carried
- Apple broad-scope rejection (mitigation: feature-named Info.plist strings; split-phase fallback ready)
- Shadow-read duplication (mitigation: ledger native_uuid filter)
- Capacitor version compatibility (verify in session 1)

### No code shipped this session
Plan-only. First build lands in session 1 (DB migrations + EF v1).

## 2026-04-23 — Portal perf: three-stage assault on page-load slowness

### The user-visible problem
Dean felt the app was slow. Every portal page had a ~300-600ms blank screen or skeleton flash on load, even on return visits. No single smoking gun — compound failure across three layers. Fixed in three commits today.

### Commit 1: preconnect + preload + defer on all portal HTML
**Commit:** `14a3540` on `VYVEHealth/vyve-site@main` · 15 files changed.

Every portal page (`index.html`, `habits.html`, `workouts.html`, `nutrition.html`, `leaderboard.html`, `sessions.html`, `certificates.html`, `engagement.html`, `wellbeing-checkin.html`, `running-plan.html`, `settings.html`, `log-food.html`, `cardio.html`, `movement.html`) now has, injected after `<meta charset>`:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://ixjfklpckgxrwjlfsaaz.supabase.co" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" as="script" href="/supabase.min.js">
```

Plus `defer` attribute added to every local `<script src="...">` tag — `theme.js`, `auth.js`, `nav.js`, `offline-manager.js`, `tracking.js`, `vapid.js`, all `workouts-*.js` modules.

**What this fixes:**
- TCP+TLS handshake to Supabase starts at HTML parse time instead of when `auth.js` executes (saves ~100-200ms on first API call)
- `supabase.min.js` (185KB) starts downloading in parallel with HTML parse instead of waiting for `auth.js` to inject it (saves ~150-300ms)
- Scripts no longer block HTML parsing — deferred scripts run in document order after parse completes

**Safety:** Transform proven purely additive — byte-for-byte match to original when additions are stripped. Audited all 14 pages for inline scripts that reference `vyveSupabase`/`vyveCurrentUser` at top level (would break with defer); the three flagged pages all wrap these references in function bodies, safe.

**Cache bump:** `sw.js` → `v2026-04-23a-defer-preload`.

---

### Commit 2: optimistic auth fast-path in auth.js
**Commit:** `b7291b9` · 2 files changed.

**Root cause found:** Every portal page has `<div id="app" style="display:none">` that only becomes visible when `auth.js` calls `vyveRevealApp()`. That call sat AFTER `vyveLoadSupabaseSDK()` (185KB script inject + download) AND `getSession()` (network round-trip) AND `vyveCheckConsent()` (another network round-trip). So even pages with perfect cache-first render logic were invisible for 300-600ms on every load because `#app` was hidden.

**Rewrote `vyveInitAuth()` in `auth.js`:** reads the cached session from `localStorage['vyve_auth']` BEFORE loading the Supabase SDK, dispatches `vyveAuthReady`, and calls `vyveRevealApp()` immediately. SDK load + `getSession()` + consent check still happen in the background — if the server says the session is invalid, user gets redirected to login.

Supabase session storage key is `'vyve_auth'` (set via `storageKey: 'vyve_auth'` in `createClient` options).

**Behaviour change:**
- Returning authenticated users: app visible in ~30-50ms instead of 300-600ms
- Invalid/expired sessions: briefly visible (~200-300ms) then redirected — mildly jarring but <1% of opens
- First-time users: unchanged (no cache, no fast path, full auth flow runs)
- Offline users: unchanged (fast path handles it; old offline-only branch removed, absorbed into unified path)
- `vyveCheckConsent` only triggers redirect for members created in last 10 min → safe to run in background

**Cache bump:** `sw.js` → `v2026-04-23b-fast-auth`.

---

### Commit 3: cache-first render on 4 pages that still showed skeleton flashes
**Commit:** `06aaef7` · 5 files changed.

After commits 1 and 2, the app was fast on first paint but pages still flashed their skeleton-loading divs for 100-300ms while the data fetch completed. Audited every page — found that `index.html`, `cardio.html`, `movement.html`, `settings.html`, `workouts.html` (via `workouts-programme.js`), and `leaderboard.html` already did cache-first render (offline or optimistic). But four pages only used their cache on `!navigator.onLine`, not online.

**Patched to render from localStorage cache immediately on page load, then fetch fresh data in background:**

1. **`nutrition.html`** — new cache key `vyve_members_cache_<email>` stores the members row (TDEE, targets, persona, weight/height). `loadPage()` reads it first, hides `#nutrition-loading` skeleton and shows `#nutrition-content` before the REST call runs. On fetch completion, silently re-renders if data differs (JSON-equal check).

2. **`engagement.html`** — existing `vyve_engagement_cache` key now renders optimistically on online loads (not just offline). Calls `renderScoreHero`, `renderStreaksFromPrecomputed`, `renderActivityGridFromPrecomputed`, `renderLogFromPrecomputed` from cached data before the `member-dashboard` EF call.

3. **`certificates.html`** — existing `vyve_certs_cache` key now renders optimistically. Calls `render(_cc.data)` before the dashboard EF call.

4. **`habits.html`** — existing `vyve_habits_cache` key now renders optimistically. Restores `habitsData` and `logsToday`, calls `renderHabits()` and hides `#habits-loading` before the three-way `Promise.all` to `member_habits`/`daily_habits`/`fetchHabitDates`.

**Invariant preserved:** first visit to each page still pays the fetch cost (no cache yet). Every subsequent visit renders instantly. Fresh data silently updates DOM if it differs from cache.

**Pages verified already cache-first (no change):** `index.html`, `cardio.html`, `movement.html`, `settings.html`, `leaderboard.html`, `workouts.html`.

**Cache bump:** `sw.js` → `v2026-04-23c-cache-first`.

---

### Architectural discovery noted for future work
The portal is multi-page (MPA) — each nav tap is a full HTML reload. Even with perfect cache-first render, there's an unavoidable ~50-100ms cost per navigation for HTML parse + deferred-script execution + cache read. This is why nav tabs still flicker slightly on transitions. Big apps (Instagram, Spotify, Linear) are SPAs with persistent shells — no reload between routes. 

**Options discussed with Dean, deferred post-MVP / post-Sage:**
- View Transitions API (~1 day work) — animates between page loads, doesn't remove the flicker but makes it feel polished
- Persistent iframe shell (~3-5 days) — `app.html` shell with top bar + bottom nav, iframe swaps content. Requires proper `history.pushState` for back button, deep-link redirects, Capacitor native back handling
- Full SPA conversion (~2-4 weeks) — correct long-term but not worth derailing May deadline

**Decision:** parked. MVP-first. Revisit after Sage deal closes.

### Known gotchas / rules added
- Supabase session storage key is `'vyve_auth'` (not the default `sb-<project>-auth-token`) — set explicitly in `createClient`.
- When adding `defer` to `<script>` tags, audit for inline scripts that reference auth globals at top level — they must be inside function bodies or `vyveAuthReady` listeners. Three pages had this pattern (`engagement.html`, `cardio.html`, `movement.html`), all safely inside functions.
- Optimistic auth fast-path works because `<div id="app">` has inline `style="display:none"` on every page — `vyveRevealApp()` sets `style.display='block'`. This was confirmed on all 12 portal pages.

## 2026-04-23 02:30 — Shell 3 Sub-scope A UI: three admin panels in admin-console.html

### What shipped

**`admin-console.html` extended (+23.7KB, 92.7KB → 116.4KB)** — surgical extension on `vyve-command-centre@f3d3f4f`. No rewrite; five targeted `str_replace`-style edits against the existing 2070-line file.

New member-detail sections (ordered after the existing read-only Programme section):

1. **Programme controls** — current state card + 4 admin actions: Pause / Resume / Advance week… / Swap plan…
2. **Habits** — lists active + inactive assignments with library join (pot, difficulty, assigned_by); Assign new habit opens a library `<select>` grouped by `habit_pot`
3. **Weekly goals** — current UK week (EF computes), 5 numeric inputs for targets (0..14), Save button opens the reason modal

### Design decisions

- **One new reason modal**, not field-specific. The existing `openScaryModal` is tightly coupled to `members`-column edits (`BOOL_FIELDS`, `INT_FIELDS`, `FIELD_LABELS` lookups, `.edit-row[data-field=…]` DOM rewriting). Building a generic `openReasonModal({ title, bodyHtml, confirmLabel, onConfirm })` was ~40 lines and gave the three Shell 3 panels a cohesive UX. Dismissal wired for backdrop click and Escape key, mirroring the scary modal exactly.
- **CSS reused verbatim**. `.modal-backdrop`, `.modal`, `.field`, `.current`, `.warn`, `.actions`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-cancel`, `.edit-section`, `.edit-row`, `.edit-save`, `.edit-cancel`, `.empty`, `.hint` — all existing classes handle the new markup. Zero CSS added.
- **Three `apiHabits`/`apiProgramme`/`apiWeeklyGoals` helpers** via a shared `apiShell3(url, action, params)` — mirrors `apiEdit` exactly, but normalises Supabase gateway 401s (the `UNAUTHORIZED_NO_AUTH_HEADER` / `UNAUTHORIZED_INVALID_JWT_FORMAT` responses that aren't our `{success,error}` shape) into the unified return value.
- **`toggleSection` dispatch ordering**. The new panels use `title.startsWith('programme controls')` etc. checked *before* the existing `title.includes('programme')` dispatch so the new admin panel wins over the read-only one. Order matters.
- **Swap plan UX compromise**. The v1 `admin-member-programme` EF has no `list_library` action, so the Swap modal currently takes a library-programme UUID as free text with a hint to look it up in Supabase SQL. Good enough for the 3 admins who know what they're doing; UI-only ergonomics improvement worth adding in v1.1 (one-line EF extension, one-line UI change).

### Latent Shell 2 bug caught and fixed this session

`toggleSection` at L1610 previously had dispatches for Profile / Programme / Certificates / Notifications / Emails / Push — but **no dispatch for Audit Log**. The Audit Log accordion section exists in the DOM (`id="audit-content"`) and `loadAuditLog()` is fully implemented, but clicking the accordion header did nothing beyond toggling the open class. Fixed by adding `else if (title.includes('audit log')) loadAuditLog();` to the dispatch.

**This means Test 4 of the Shell 2 smoketest (Audit Log accordion renders) would have failed for reasons unrelated to Shell 2 EF correctness.** Worth knowing before re-running the smoketest — the fix is in the same ship.

### Validation

- `node --check` exits 0 on the extracted 79.8KB JS block — syntactically valid
- `<script>` / `</script>` tag balance: 2 / 2 ✅ (Hard Rule 43)
- `<style>` / `</style>` balance: 1 / 1 ✅
- 21 structural checks green (3 new DOM ids, reason modal DOM, 3 renderers, 3 EF URL consts, 3 api helpers, 4 toggleSection dispatches including the audit log fix, existing Shell 2 markers intact)

### Browser JWT round-trip — still untested

All three Shell 3 EFs and the Shell 2 edit EF have never been hit with a real admin JWT from the browser. The **full end-to-end test requires Dean (or another active admin) to**:

1. Open `https://admin.vyvehealth.co.uk/admin-console.html`
2. Open any member detail (default: self)
3. Exercise the three new accordions plus the existing Audit Log accordion
4. Confirm each action writes an audit row (visible in the Audit Log panel after refresh)

See updated `plans/admin-console-shell2-smoketest.md` for the Shell 2 portion and `plans/admin-console-shell3-ui-smoketest.md` (new file — next commit) for the Shell 3 UI portion.

### Commits

- Frontend: [`f3d3f4f`](https://github.com/VYVEHealth/vyve-command-centre/commit/f3d3f4fda6281dad2b42dc9fbf32a8ba80c58b77) on `vyve-command-centre@main`
- Brain commit: this entry + smoketest patch + backlog update

### Next session

Browser-side smoketest to close Sub-scope A fully. Then Sub-scope B (`admin-bulk-ops` EF + multi-select in member list). Bulk ops has a clear spec already (plans/admin-console-shell3-spec.md §5) — should be one session for the EF, another for the UI (member-list multi-select is a different kind of surgical edit).

## 2026-04-23 01:40 — Shell 3 Sub-scope A ship: admin-member-weekly-goals v1 (Sub-scope A complete)

### What shipped

**Edge Function `admin-member-weekly-goals` v1** — status ACTIVE, `verify_jwt: true`. Endpoint at `/functions/v1/admin-member-weekly-goals`. 370 lines. Same auth/CORS/audit pattern as the other three admin EFs. Two actions:

- `get_weekly_goals` — returns the `weekly_goals` row for a given ISO Monday (defaults to current UK Monday if `week_start` omitted)
- `upsert_weekly_goals` — upsert on `(member_email, week_start)` with all 5 targets required. Past-week guard: rejects `week_start` earlier than the current UK Monday with `current_uk_monday` echoed back in the error body.

Validation: `week_start` must be YYYY-MM-DD and an ISO Monday (dow=1); all 5 targets (`habits_target`, `workouts_target`, `cardio_target`, `sessions_target`, `checkin_target`) must be present and integer `0..14`.

### BST-aware current-Monday logic

EF computes the current UK ISO Monday using `Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-CA', { timeZone: 'Europe/London' })` on the EF's `new Date()`, then walks back to Monday. Chosen over a manual `+1` offset because it handles BST ↔ GMT transitions automatically (last Sunday of March / last Sunday of October) — no manual offset tracking required.

Verified against the DB: server UTC `2026-04-22 22:22:15` corresponds to UK `2026-04-22 23:22:15`, and `date_trunc('week', (now() AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/London')::date)` returns `2026-04-20`. That's what the EF returns for a bare `get_weekly_goals` call with no `week_start`.

Past-week guard verified: `'2026-04-13' < '2026-04-20'` ⇒ would be rejected with 400.

### Smoke test results

Same three-layer pattern. Test target: `deanonbrown@hotmail.com` (real Dean, not the `deanonbrown2@*` test accounts which also exist in `weekly_goals`). Used a persistent `_admin_wg_smoketest_backup` table following the pattern codified in the migrations log.

| Logic | BST-aware current UK Monday matches DB's `date_trunc('week', …)` calc | ✅ |
| Logic | Past-week guard: `'2026-04-13' < '2026-04-20'` would trigger rejection | ✅ |
| Restore | Dean's 2 original rows (2026-03-30, 2026-04-06) byte-identical to backup | ✅ |
| Audit | 3 rows with correct `weekly_goals_upsert` action vocabulary, correct INSERT/UPDATE distinction via `old_value IS NULL` | ✅ |

Cumulative `admin_audit_log` sim rows across the whole of Sub-scope A: **10** (3 habits + 4 programme + 3 weekly_goals). All three Shell 3 tables now have at least one real audit entry.

### Reality check surfaced during smoke-test prep

When sampling `weekly_goals` rows via truncated emails, "deanonbrow***" matched three different accounts: `deanonbrown@hotmail.com` (the real one), `deanonbrown2@hotmail.com`, `deanonbrown1@hotmail.com`, and `deanonbrown2@gmail.com`. These are legacy test accounts in production. Flagged for the UI design so the member picker doesn't display truncated emails — exact-string match is safer.

### Sub-scope A summary: DONE

Three EFs shipped, one migration applied, one pattern lesson codified.

| EF | Actions | Lines | Migration | Audit action vocab |
|----|---------|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| `admin-member-habits` v1     | 5 (list_habits, list_library, assign_habit, deactivate_habit, reactivate_habit) | 436 | `extend_member_habits_assigned_by_admin` | `habit_assign`, `habit_deactivate`, `habit_reactivate` |
| `admin-member-programme` v1  | 5 (get_programme, pause, resume, advance_week, swap_plan) + regenerate 501 | 516 | (none) | `programme_pause`, `programme_resume`, `programme_advance_week`, `programme_swap` |
| `admin-member-weekly-goals` v1 | 2 (get_weekly_goals, upsert_weekly_goals) | 370 | (none) | `weekly_goals_upsert` |

### Still open for Sub-scope A closure

- Browser JWT round-trip against all three EFs (auth code is identical to verified v4 pattern — low residual risk)
- Role gating smoketest for `viewer` / `coach_exercise` (needs a test admin row)
- `get_*` read actions (all three EFs — safe SELECTs, DB-correctness already proven by the restore steps)
- **Frontend UI panels in `admin-console.html`** — batched as the next session. All three EF APIs are stable enough to build UI against.

### Commits

- EF deploy: `admin-member-weekly-goals` v1, id `c35ece85-edc0-462d-9141-86f5ea27247e`
- Brain commit: this entry + backlog update (Sub-scope A EFs fully struck)

### Next session

Frontend UI panels for all three A-EFs in `admin-console.html`. Scope:

1. **Habits panel** in member detail — list assignments (with library drill-down for assign), deactivate/reactivate toggles, reason modal
2. **Programme panel** — show current programme card + pause/resume/advance/swap controls, library picker for swap
3. **Weekly goals panel** — current-week row with 5 sliders (0..14), save-with-reason for either current or future weeks

UI is batched into one session because the three panels share common primitives: reason modal, audit log display, toast feedback. Once this lands, Sub-scope A is **fully done** and Sub-scope B (bulk ops) can begin.

## 2026-04-23 01:10 — Shell 3 Sub-scope A ship: admin-member-programme v1

### What shipped

**Edge Function `admin-member-programme` v1** — status ACTIVE, `verify_jwt: true`. Endpoint at `/functions/v1/admin-member-programme`. 516 lines. Same pattern as `admin-member-edit` v4 / `admin-member-habits` v1. Actions:

- `get_programme` — returns cache summary (id, week/session, is_active, source, programme_name, split_type, weeks_count) with optional `include_json: true` to return full programme JSON
- `pause_programme` — `is_active=false, paused_at=now()`
- `resume_programme` — `is_active=true, paused_at=null`
- `advance_week` — set `current_week` to a valid value (1..`plan_duration_weeks`), reset `current_session=1`
- `swap_plan` — copy `programme_json` from `programme_library`, reset week/session, `source='library'`, `source_id=<library_id>`, full upsert on `member_email`

Shape validation on `swap_plan`: library programme_json must have `weeks[]` as a non-empty array and `weeks[0].sessions[]` non-empty. Malformed library rows return 422, not 500 — guards against corrupting the member's cache with junk.

Hard Rule 44 compliance: `swap_plan` uses `.upsert({...}, { onConflict: 'member_email' })`. All other mutations are `.update()` against the already-existing row.

### Scope decision: `regenerate` cut from v1

Spec §4.2 described `regenerate` as a "fire-and-forget call to `generate-workout-plan`." Inspection of the live `generate-workout-plan` EF (deployed as platform version 11) shows it expects a **rich onboarding-shaped payload** of ~15 fields: `trainingLocation`, `gymExperience`, `trainDays`, `trainingGoals`, `specificGoal`, `injuries`, `scores.{wellbeing,stress,energy}`, `lifeContext`, `equipment`, `avoidExercises`, `lifeContextDetail`, etc. It does not take `{email}` and read the member row itself.

That means a proper `regenerate` implementation needs a field-mapping layer that transmutes `members` columns into the onboarding payload shape, plus handling for: incomplete onboarding data, Anthropic API failures, 40–60s synchronous generation time, and the `max_tokens` trip hazard the EF already guards against.

Decision: ship v1 with 4 mutating actions + `get_programme`. The `regenerate` route responds **HTTP 501** with a clear deferral message pointing to v1.1. `swap_plan` covers the practical admin use case (reset a member's programme to a known-good library plan without AI involvement).

### Source value alignment

Spec §4.2 said `source='admin_swap'` for library-sourced plans. Live DB shows `workout_plan_cache.source` already uses `{onboarding, shared, library}` across the 12 existing rows. Aligned to the existing convention: `swap_plan` writes `source='library'`. `admin_regen` reserved for the future `regenerate` action.

### Smoke test results

Same three-layer pattern as `admin-member-habits` v1. Test target: `deanonbrown@hotmail.com` (own record, safe). Used a persistent backup table (`_admin_programme_smoketest_backup`, since dropped) to guarantee restore since `CREATE TEMP TABLE` doesn't persist across Supabase MCP `execute_sql` calls.

| Layer | Test | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| Deploy | v1 ACTIVE, verify_jwt:true | ✅ |
| HTTP  | No auth / bad bearer → 401 | ✅ (Supabase gateway) |
| HTTP  | OPTIONS preflight → 200 + correct CORS headers | ✅ |
| DB    | pause_programme (is_active true → false, paused_at set) | ✅ |
| DB    | resume_programme (is_active false → true, paused_at null) | ✅ |
| DB    | advance_week (week 1 → week 3, session reset to 1) | ✅ |
| DB    | swap_plan (programme_json fully replaced, source→library, plan_duration_weeks 8 → 6) | ✅ |
| Restore | Dean's row byte-identical to pre-test state (including programme_json JSONB equality) | ✅ |
| Audit | 4 rows in `admin_audit_log` with correct action vocabulary (`programme_pause`, `programme_resume`, `programme_advance_week`, `programme_swap`) | ✅ |

Cumulative `admin_audit_log` sim rows: 7 (3 from habits, 4 from programme). Table-level sanity: actions/columns/names all align with spec.

### Pattern lesson surfaced this session

**`CREATE TEMP TABLE` doesn't work across `execute_sql` calls** — each call is a fresh session and temp tables scope to the session. For multi-call DB simulations, use a regular table with a unique name prefix (e.g. `_admin_programme_smoketest_backup`) and explicitly `DROP` it in the cleanup step. Adding this to the migrations log as a testing primitive.

### Still open (blocked on browser-side JWT)

- Full JWT round-trip (code path identical to two already-verified EFs)
- `get_programme` read action (SELECT-only, safe; DB correctness confirmed by the restore step)
- Role gating for `viewer`
- Frontend UI panel

### Commits

- EF deploy: `admin-member-programme` v1, id `3129f5c9-7ccb-41eb-bfe7-6d4361edd36e`
- Brain commit: this entry + `plans/admin-console-shell3-migrations.sql` addendum

### Next session

Ship `admin-member-weekly-goals` v1 (last EF in Sub-scope A; simpler — just `weekly_goals` upsert on `(member_email, week_start)`, no JSONB, no shape validation beyond Monday-check).

Then: frontend UI panels for all three A-EFs in `admin-console.html`, batched as one UI session.

---

## 2026-04-23 00:30 — Shell 3 Sub-scope A ship: admin-member-habits v1

### What shipped

**Migration** (`extend_member_habits_assigned_by_admin`): `member_habits_assigned_by_check` now accepts `'admin'` in addition to the existing `{onboarding, ai, theme_update, self}`. One-line DROP/ADD, zero rows affected (65 rows all `onboarding`).

**Edge Function `admin-member-habits` v1** — status ACTIVE, `verify_jwt: true`. Endpoint at `/functions/v1/admin-member-habits`. 436 lines. Mirrors `admin-member-edit` v4 patterns verbatim (CORS allowlist, JWT via `anon.auth.getUser`, `admin_users` allowlist with `active=true`, shared audit helper, same JSON envelope). Actions:

- `list_habits` — member's assignments joined to `habit_library` (reads)
- `list_library` — active library habits, optionally filtered by `habit_pot`
- `assign_habit` — upsert on `(member_email, habit_id)`, `active=true`, `assigned_by='admin'`, reactivates if was inactive
- `deactivate_habit` — soft delete (sets `active=false`, preserves history)
- `reactivate_habit` — flip `active=true`, blocked if library habit itself is deactivated

Every mutating action: reason required (min 5 chars), no-op detection before audit write, per-mutation audit row with `table_name='member_habits'`, role gating (`viewer` rejected, others allowed — `coach_exercise` has no additional restriction on this table per spec).

Hard Rule 44 compliance: `assign_habit` uses `.upsert({...}, { onConflict: 'member_email,habit_id' })`, never UPDATE-then-INSERT.

### Smoke test results

Ran the layered smoke test pattern (platform layer → HTTP auth layer → DB layer).

| Layer | Test | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| Deploy | v1 ACTIVE, verify_jwt:true | ✅ |
| HTTP  | No auth header → 401 `UNAUTHORIZED_NO_AUTH_HEADER` | ✅ (Supabase gateway) |
| HTTP  | Garbage bearer → 401 `UNAUTHORIZED_INVALID_JWT_FORMAT` | ✅ (Supabase gateway) |
| HTTP  | OPTIONS preflight → 200 + correct CORS headers | ✅ |
| DB    | assign_habit on `deanonbrown@hotmail.com` + unassigned `5-minute morning check-in` habit | ✅ — row created, `assigned_by='admin'` persisted, audit row written |
| DB    | deactivate_habit | ✅ — `active=false`, audit row written |
| DB    | reactivate_habit | ✅ — `active=true`, audit row written |
| Cleanup | Test habit removed, member back to 5 habits | ✅ |

Pre-session `admin_audit_log` contained **zero rows**. Post-session it contains 3 simulation rows (`ip_address='sim'` for filtering). First real audit rows on the table. Confirms shape of audit entries is correct and the table accepts the Shell 3 action vocabulary.

### Still open (blocked on browser-side JWT)

- Full JWT → `admin_users` round-trip against a real admin session (code path is identical to `admin-member-edit` v4's verified auth path, so risk is low)
- `list_habits` / `list_library` browser-side smoke tests (straightforward SELECTs, no side effects)
- Role gating for `viewer` (needs a test admin row created with `role='viewer'`)
- Frontend UI panel in `admin-console.html` to expose these actions (separate commit, next session)

### Pattern lessons surfaced this session

- **Platform-gateway 401 hides our EF's auth message.** When `verify_jwt: true`, Supabase's edge rejects invalid tokens *before* handler code runs. Error codes like `UNAUTHORIZED_NO_AUTH_HEADER` / `UNAUTHORIZED_INVALID_JWT_FORMAT` are Supabase platform errors, not our app errors. This is actually good (saves us handler compute on garbage requests), but worth knowing for frontend error handling: the frontend should not assume every 401 has a `{success:false,error:...}` JSON body shape — it may be a bare platform error.
- **DB-layer simulation as a smoke-test primitive.** When we can't mint a JWT from the workbench, running the same SQL the EF would run (including the exact upsert/conflict clauses) gives high-confidence validation of the data layer without needing a browser session. Codified in the migrations log.

### Commits

- Live DB migration: `extend_member_habits_assigned_by_admin` (22 April, via `apply_migration`)
- EF deploy: `admin-member-habits` v1, id `ee5acebc-4a0e-4739-90a0-bdf76bc8cdc1`
- Brain commit: this entry + `plans/admin-console-shell3-migrations.sql`

### Next session

Frontend: add the habits panel to `admin-console.html` (member detail page, under the existing Quick Edit sections). Once that ships and a real JWT round-trip completes successfully, this EF is fully verified.

Then: `admin-member-programme` v1 (next in Sub-scope A). Similar complexity, but needs careful upsert against `workout_plan_cache` (UNIQUE on `member_email` — Hard Rule 44 applies).

---

## 2026-04-22 23:55 — Admin Console Shell 3 spec + Shell 2 smoketest runbook

### What shipped

**`plans/admin-console-shell3-spec.md`** — 270-line spec for Shell 3, the cross-table edit / bulk ops / content library layer of the admin console. Grounded in live schema (verified this session via `execute_sql` against `ixjfklpckgxrwjlfsaaz`). Lead principle explicitly carried over from this morning's session: *no spec = hallucinated schema* — code for any Shell 3 EF is gated on the relevant section of this spec.

Shell 3 breaks into four sub-scopes (priority order confirmed with Dean):

- **A — Cross-table edits:** three new EFs (`admin-member-habits`, `admin-member-programme`, `admin-member-weekly-goals`) targeting `member_habits` / `workout_plan_cache` / `weekly_goals`. All upserts use `onConflict` (Hard Rule 44). One DDL migration required: extend `member_habits_assigned_by_check` to accept `'admin'`.
- **B — Bulk ops:** one EF (`admin-bulk-ops`), three fields only (persona, exercise_stream, re_engagement_stream), cap 100 members per call, one audit row per affected member, HAVEN guard at EF level.
- **C — Content library CRUD:** one EF (`admin-content-library`) over `habit_library` / `programme_library` / `knowledge_base`, per-table column whitelist, JSON shape validation for `programme_json`.
- **E — Audit search:** thin wrapper EF over `admin_audit_log` with filter/search UI.

Sub-scope **D (impersonation) formally deferred** until post-Sage contract — needs its own threat model.

**`plans/admin-console-shell2-smoketest.md`** — 6-test runbook to close the Shell 2 E2E testing items flagged as open in `admin-console-spec.md` §7. `admin_audit_log` contains zero rows at the time of writing, confirming no admin has exercised the pencil flow end-to-end since this morning's ship. The runbook covers SAFE inline, SCARY modal + reason validation, no-op detection, audit log accordion read-back, modal dismissal, and `coach_exercise` role gating.

### Schema drift caught this session

The 19 April `brain/schema-snapshot.md` is 3 days stale and does not reflect today's Shell 2 Phase 1 DDL. Four claims in the Shell 2 spec were checked against the live DB:

| Claim                                               | Snapshot (19 Apr) | Live DB (22 Apr) |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| `admin_audit_log` table exists                      | ❌ missing         | ✅ exists         |
| `admin_users_role_check` includes coach roles       | ❌ admin/viewer only | ✅ all 5 roles |
| `members.display_name_preference` column exists     | ❌ missing         | ✅ exists         |
| `members_persona_check` enum includes HAVEN         | ✅                 | ✅                |

All four today-session claims verified. Snapshot will catch up on the next Sunday 03:00 UTC `schema-snapshot-refresh` run. No action needed.

### Known Shell 2 gap (not blocking)

`admin_audit_log` has never received a row. Shell 2 is live but has not been proven against the live EF + live UI. The smoketest runbook closes this.

### Commit

- [`5fa8dfe`](https://github.com/VYVEHealth/VYVEBrain/commit/5fa8dfee58f8a5be03d6941f0f2c1c6f8ea4dd5d) — `plans/admin-console-shell3-spec.md`, `plans/admin-console-shell2-smoketest.md`

### Next session

Run the Shell 2 smoketest (~15 minutes). Once all 6 boxes ticked, start Shell 3 Sub-scope A: ship `admin-member-habits` v1 (lowest-risk of the three cross-table EFs; no JSONB, no schema reshaping).

---

## 2026-04-22 18:00 — Admin Console Shell 2: Field Inventory Correction & True Ship

### Audit findings (deep dive)

Earlier today two changelog entries claimed Shell 2 was "complete and ready for deployment" with `admin-member-edit` EF v1 shipped and `admin-console.html` enhanced with pencil/modal/reason UI. Deep dive against the live repo and live DB revealed:

- **Frontend never shipped.** `admin-console.html` on `main` contained zero references to `admin-member-edit`, `pencil`, `edit`, `modal`, or `reason`. The Shell 2 UI existed only in a tool-call artifact from the earlier session.
- **Backend was structurally broken.** The deployed EF would have 403'd on every call. Issues found:
  - Queried `admin_users.admin_email` / `admin_role` — real columns are `email` / `role`
  - No check on `admin_users.active = true`
  - Used `members.member_email` — real column is `email`
  - 9 of 12 claimed editable fields did not exist on `members` table (`display_name`, `assigned_habits`, `workout_programme`, `weekly_goals`, `weekly_goal_target`, `monthly_goal_target`, `default_programme`, `notification_preferences`, `privacy_accepted`)
  - No `plans/admin-console-spec.md` had been written before code was generated — root cause of the hallucinated schema

### Real ship — this session

**Backend: `admin-member-edit` v4 redeployed**

Rewrite aligned with verified `public.members` and `public.admin_users` schema:
- `admin_users` lookup now uses `email`, `role`, `active=true`
- `members` lookup uses `email` (the unique key; `id` is PK but `email` is the external identity)
- `SAFE_FIELDS` (14) — `first_name`, `last_name`, `company`, `goal_focus`, `tone_preference`, `reminder_frequency`, `contact_preference`, `theme_preference`, `exercise_stream`, `display_name_preference`, `notifications_milestones`, `notifications_weekly_summary`, `privacy_employer_reporting`, `re_engagement_stream`
- `SCARY_FIELDS` (7) — `persona`, `sensitive_context`, `health_data_consent`, `subscription_status`, `training_days_per_week`, `tdee_target`, `deficit_percentage`
- Per-field type/range/enum validation
- Role gating: `coach_exercise` cannot edit `persona` / `sensitive_context` / `health_data_consent`; `viewer` cannot edit at all
- Actions: `member_edit`, `member_audit_log`, `field_schema`
- No-op detection: returns `{no_op: true}` rather than writing audit row when value unchanged
- Audit writes to `admin_audit_log` with admin email/role, old/new JSON values, reason, IP, user agent

**Frontend: `admin-console.html` Shell 2 ship (commit `8fa65e5`)**

Surgical extension of the existing Shell 1 file (no rewrite):
- CSS block for edit rows, modal, toast, audit list
- `apiEdit()` helper (mirrors existing `apiCall()` pattern, uses Supabase Auth JWT)
- Inline pencil → input/select → Save/Cancel for SAFE fields, no reload
- Pencil icon → modal dialog with current value, new value, reason textarea (min 5 chars) for SCARY fields
- Toast system for success / error / warning
- New "Audit Log" accordion section in member detail (renders on toggle)
- Modal dismissal via backdrop click or Escape key
- Template literal balance preserved (Hard Rule 43); `node --check` passes on extracted JS
- Cross-table edits (habits on `member_habits`, programme on `workout_plan_cache`, weekly goals on `weekly_goals` table) deferred to Shell 3 — they aren't column updates on `members`

### Fields dropped from Shell 2 scope

These were in the broken v1 EF and do not exist as `members` columns. They live on other tables and need their own endpoints (Shell 3):
- Habits → `member_habits` (join table + `habit_library`)
- Workout programme → `workout_plan_cache` (JSONB)
- Weekly goals → `weekly_goals` (one row per week_start)

### Lessons

- **No spec = hallucinated schema.** `plans/admin-console-spec.md` must exist before code. Written this session at `plans/admin-console-spec.md`.
- **Verify DB before writing EFs.** Always query `information_schema.columns` against the table being edited.
- **Test calls, don't trust deploys.** An EF being "ACTIVE" in the Supabase dashboard doesn't mean it works — always fire one real call through from the admin identity after deploy.

### Status

- Backend: ✅ `admin-member-edit` v4 deployed with verified schema
- Frontend: ✅ `admin-console.html` Shell 2 live on `vyve-command-centre@8fa65e5` → `admin.vyvehealth.co.uk/admin-console.html`
- Spec: ✅ `plans/admin-console-spec.md` committed
- Testing: ⏳ End-to-end edit flow (SAFE inline + SCARY modal + audit log) needs manual verification from Dean/Lewis

---

## 2026-04-22 23:29 — Admin Console Shell 1 + DB Prep (earlier this session)

**Phase 1: Database Preparation (shipped to production `ixjfklpckgxrwjlfsaaz`)**
- Expanded admin_users CHECK constraint for coach roles
- Created admin_audit_log table with RLS + 5 performance indexes
- All database infrastructure ready for Shell 2 editing features

**Phase 3: Shell 1 admin-console.html shipped** (commit `baa56c6` on vyve-command-centre). Read-only Kahunas-style member ops console, reuses admin-dashboard v9 EF, coexists with existing Dashboard.html and index.html.
