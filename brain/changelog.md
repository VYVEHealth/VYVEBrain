## PM-554 stabilisation — first-run tour fixed to 4-step home-only (2026-06-07)

Multiple fix commits (fix2–fix8) through session. Root causes resolved:
- **fix5:** `_started` guard + single `vyveAuthReady` trigger prevented double-init race between 1500ms setTimeout and auth event.
- **fix6:** sessions.html was retired (PM-555 redirect) — tour destination corrected to connect-calendar.html.
- **fix8 (final):** Eliminated all cross-page hops entirely. Tour is now 4 steps, all on index.html — mood, focus, habits, rings. No resume cursor, no page navigation, no race conditions. Completes reliably and sets `vyve_firstrun_done` on Done.

**Final state:** intro slides (4) + home spotlight (4 steps). Copy is DRAFT in `COPY` object top of firstrun.js — Lewis edits in place.

## PM-554 — PF-23 v1 first-run experience shipped (2026-06-07)

### What shipped
- **`firstrun.js`** — full first-run engine: 4 swipeable intro slides (Part 1) + 7-step in-context spotlight tour (Part 2). Gate: `localStorage.vyve_firstrun_done` short-circuit → Dexie members row `tour_completed_at` check (~800ms cold-boot wait) → run. Resume cursor (`vyve_tour_active` + `vyve_tour_step`) persists across the two page hops (index→mind, mind→sessions). Dismissal (skip or done): sets `vyve_firstrun_done=1`, clears cursor, fires un-awaited `members.update({tour_completed_at})` via member-scoped RLS (§23.31). All copy in a single `COPY` object at top of file — Lewis edits that, never the logic.
- **`firstrun.css`** — scrim + box-shadow cutout overlay + tooltip card + slide dot strip + safe-area insets (§23.58) + web-tells suppression (§23.59). z-index 10000–10002 (above nav 9000).
- **`index.html`, `mind.html`, `sessions.html`** — load `firstrun.css` + `firstrun.js`. Haptics.js confirmed present on all three (§23.44). mind/sessions inert unless tour active.
- **`settings.html`** — vbb-marker bumped to 424.
- **`sw.js`** — CACHE_NAME `vyve-cache-v2026-06-07-pm554-firstrun`; `firstrun.js` + `firstrun.css` added to precache (§23.76).
- **`member-dashboard` EF v78** — adds `tour_completed_at` to member snapshot payload (column already in `members` table via migration this session).
- **DB migration** — `ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tour_completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ` applied and verified.

### Key decisions
- Explanatory v1 only (no per-step achievements, decoupled from Achievements overhaul). Action-tutorial is a later iteration.
- Multi-page in-context spotlight: home→mind→sessions. Viable because snapshot-first paint renders hops <200ms.
- Dismissal writes `tour_completed_at` server-side (reinstall-safe, cross-device) via member-scoped RLS — no EF needed.
- Anchor-ready guard: rAF poll ~1.5s, timeout→container fallback — never spotlights an empty skeleton (§23.36/§23.47).
- `vyve:auth:ready` event also triggers init as an earlier path alongside the 1.5s DOMContentLoaded delay.

### §23 rules confirmed
