# VYVE Health — Task Backlog

> Updated: 18 April 2026 (Session: Full reconciliation + `schema-snapshot-refresh` EF/cron + `generate-workout-plan` un-retire)

---

## Active Priorities (This Weekend)

1. **Android icon fix** — resubmitted 15 April, awaiting Google review
2. **iOS icon fix** — app live but icon wrong, Build 2 uploaded
3. **Exercise restructure** — Option A (Exercise Hub). Plan at `VYVEBrain/plans/exercise-restructure.md`.
   - ~~Hub page shipped (`exercise.html`)~~
   - ~~Sub-page headers & back buttons (`nav.js`, `workouts.html`, `movement.html`, `cardio.html`) — 20 April~~
   - `movement.html` / `cardio.html` Supabase data wiring — currently static mock data only
   - Skeleton-timeout watchdog + `vyveAuthReady` gating on `movement.html` / `cardio.html`
   - `welcome.html` onboarding questionnaire update (exercise-type question)
   - Onboarding EF: AI routing to assign Movement/Cardio as primary plan
4. **Deploy `admin.html` to `admin.vyvehealth.co.uk`** — file committed at `apps/admin-dashboard/admin.html` in `vyve-command-centre`, needs GitHub Pages hosting. Admin users already seeded (Dean + Lewis).
5. **Polish and bug-fix pass** — test all flows, fix on-the-fly issues
6. **Target: sell-ready by May 2026**

---

## This Week

- **HealthKit / Health Connect integration** — Capacitor plugin; habits linked to activity; weight from smart scales. Needs scoping session.
- **Calendar integration** — connect Google/Apple calendar, show VYVE sessions and workout schedule
- **Calendar page in portal** — dedicated schedule view

---

## Security Quick Wins (from 16 April audit — status after 18 April)

### Done
- ~~Add indexes on `workouts(member_email)`, `cardio(member_email)`, `certificates(member_email)`, `ai_interactions(member_email)`~~ **DONE 18 April**
- ~~Add `logged_at DESC` indexes across activity tables~~ **DONE 18 April**

### Open
- Fix XSS: escape `firstName` in `index.html` before `innerHTML` rendering
- Fix `running_plan_cache` RLS: change `public_update` policy to `member_email = auth.email()`
- Fix INSERT policies on `session_chat`, `shared_workouts`, `monthly_checkins`
- Remove 3 redundant RLS policies on `members` table
- Add explicit service-role-only policies to the 7 aggregation/admin tables (document intent)
- Add `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"/>` to remaining 12 portal pages (was 13; `wellbeing-checkin.html` added 18 April)
- **Clean up one-shot migration EFs** — ~9 remain (was "89 dead" before most were deleted in the 9 April / 11 April cleanups). Candidates for deletion: `seed-library-1`, `seed-library-2`, `seed-b1`, `create-ai-decisions-table`, `setup-ai-decisions`, `setup-member-units`, `trigger-owen-workout`, `trigger-callum-workout`, `thumbnail-batch-upload`, `generate-stuart-plan`, `send-stuart-reset`. Keep `ban-user-anthony` if ban workflow still in use.

## Brain Hygiene (from 18 April reconciliation)

### Done this session
- ~~master.md §4: correct the "No triggers" / "No foreign keys" claims~~ **DONE 18 April — actual counts: 119 triggers, 25 FKs (not 14/24 as the previous note said)**
- ~~master.md §4: document the aggregation layer~~ **DONE 18 April — 7 tables + 11 functions + 4 cron jobs documented, Rule 33 added**
- ~~master.md §10: add Rule 33 — aggregation tables are EF-service-role only~~ **DONE 18 April** (+ Rule 34 DB-level caps, Rule 35 email auto-lowercasing)
- ~~Brain reconciliation: update EF inventory~~ **DONE 18 April — all 58 active EFs documented with live versions, missing ones added (admin-dashboard, cc-data, send-password-reset, warm-ping, leaderboard)**
- ~~Automate or delete `brain/schema-snapshot.md`~~ **DONE 18 April — automated via `schema-snapshot-refresh` EF v2 + `vyve_schema_snapshot` cron (Sunday 03:00 UTC). GitHub writes via new fine-grained `GITHUB_PAT_BRAIN` secret (VYVEBrain contents:write only). First auto-commit: [36384af](https://github.com/VYVEHealth/VYVEBrain/commit/36384afa58c9b8381a4d37d6e65545f714ea7229).**
- ~~Resolve `generate-workout-plan` EF ambiguity~~ **DONE 18 April — un-retired. Kept as canonical standalone plan generator. Onboarding v74 duplicates logic inline; refactor task added below.**

### Open
- **Audit portal pages for bare `<nav>` tags** — `wellbeing-checkin.html` shipped with a bare `nav { }` selector instead of `nav.desktop-nav`, causing mobile overlap + zoom. Grep the remaining portal HTML files for the same pattern so we can codify Rule 36 (all page-level navs must use `.desktop-nav` class) rather than waiting for user reports.
- **Add `monthly-checkin` integration smoke test** — the column drift that caused the 500 would have been caught by a single POST test against the live schema. Consider a Deno test that runs against a throwaway test member before each deploy. Surfaced by 18 April fix session.
- **Delete `staging/onboarding_v67.ts`** — stale by 7 versions (live is v74). Misleads future AI sessions.
- **Resolve `auth.js` version disagreement** inside master.md (§3 says v2.3, §12 says v2.4 — pick one)
- **Archive pre-April changelog entries** into `changelog-archive/2026-Q1.md` — current changelog is 114KB / 1,658 lines and growing unboundedly
- **Document user-ban workflow** — `ban-user-anthony` v8 exists; anthony.clickit@gmail.com is in `auth.users` with no `public.members` row (orphan). Decide on a reusable pattern if bans will happen again.

## Offline Mode — SHIPPED 17 April 2026 ✅

Auth fast-path (`vyve_auth` cached session) + localStorage data caches on all EF-calling pages + `offline-manager.js` banner + write-action disabling. Full coverage: index, habits, engagement, certificates, leaderboard (full cache), workouts, nutrition, sessions, wellbeing-checkin.

## Admin Dashboard — SHIPPED 18 April 2026 (needs hosting) ✅ / 🟡

Single-file HTML dashboard (`apps/admin-dashboard/admin.html`), `admin-dashboard` Edge Function v6, aggregation layer extended, source-table indexes added. **Blocked only on deployment target** — see Active Priorities #4. See `plans/admin-dashboard.md`.

## Design System — Phase Roadmap

- ~~**Phase A: Token foundation**~~ ✅ Done 17 April 2026
- ~~**Phase B: Semantic colour migration**~~ ✅ Done 17 April 2026
- ~~**Phase C: Session-page template consolidation**~~ ✅ Done 17 April 2026 — 14 stubs + 4 shared files
- **Phase D: Component primitives** (~2 days) — Shared `.btn`, `.card`, `.input`, `.modal-sheet` classes. Removes 72 unique button class names, 90 unique card class names.
- **Phase E: Typography + spacing scale migration** (~1 day) — Replace 118 unique font-size values and 264 unique padding values with `--text-*`, `--space-*` tokens.
- **Future: `VYVE_Health_Hub.html` redesign + PWA linking** — Out of scope for Phases A-E. Planned for later.

---

## Soon

- **Refactor onboarding v74 to call `generate-workout-plan` EF** — remove ~120 lines of inline duplicated logic. EF has a richer implementation (dedicated programme-overview step, better prompts, cleaner video enrichment) than onboarding's inline copy. ~2 hrs, zero-risk if deployed atomically. Surfaced by 18 April reconciliation.
- **In-app onboarding fallback** — simplified questionnaire inside portal for members with no workout plan (~3-4 hrs)
- **Onboarding resilience: save-answers-first** — progressive answer saving + error screen (~2-3 hrs)
- **Load `vapid.js` on other portal pages** — currently only `index.html` has push subscription
- **`certificate-checker` push notification** — send push when cert earned
- **HAVEN clinical sign-off** — formally decide: approve as-is or gate pending professional review. HAVEN is actively being assigned (Conor Warren, 15 April 2026).
- **Dashboard data date-range filter** — `member-dashboard` EF fetches ALL historical data, needs 90-day limit
- **Hash emails before sending to PostHog**

---

## Later

- Social activity feed (spec at VYVEBrain, pending Lewis sign-off on 7 product decisions)
- Dashboard widget customisation
- Persona context modifier system
- AI weekly goals Phase 2 (behavioural goals from check-in data)
- Weekly progress summary email (blocked on Lewis copy)
- PostHog / Supabase Auth identity wiring
- Milestone message system
- Today's Progress dot strip (blocked on Lewis copy)
- Re-engagement automations x3 (blocked on Lewis email copy)
- Live viewer count on sessions (only display when 20+ viewers)
